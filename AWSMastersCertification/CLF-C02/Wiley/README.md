# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Study Guide With 500 Practice Test Questions: Foundational (CLF-C02) Exam, 2nd Edition

## Chapter 1: The Cloud

1. Which of the following does not contribute significantly to the operational value of a large cloud provider like AWS?

    - Metered, pay‐per‐use pricing
    <br>
    
    > Having globally distributed infrastructure and experienced security engineers makes a provider’s infrastructure more reliable. Metered pricing makes a wider range of workloads possible.

<br>

2. Which of the following are signs of a highly available application? (Choose two.)
    - A failure in one geographic region will trigger an automatic failover to resources in a different region.
    - Spikes in user demand are met through automatically increasing resources.
    <br>
    
    > Security and virtualization are both important characteristics of successful cloud workloads, but neither will directly impact availability.

<br>

3. How does the metered payment model make many benefits of cloud computing possible? (Choose two.)
    - Experiments with multiple configuration options are now cost‐effective.
    - Full‐stack applications are possible without the need to invest in capital expenses.
    <br>
    
    > Security and scalability are important cloud elements but are not related to metered pricing.

<br>

4. Which of the following are direct benefits of server virtualization? (Choose two.)

    - Fast resource provisioning and launching
    - Efficient (high-density) use of resources
    <br>
    
    > Security and elasticity are important but are not directly related to server virtualization.

<br>

5. What is a hypervisor?
    - Software used to administer virtualized resources run on physical infrastructure
    <br>
    
    > A hypervisor is software (not hardware) that administers virtualized operations.

<br>

6. Which of the following best describes server virtualization?
    - Logically partitioning physical compute and storage devices into multiple smaller virtual devices
    <br>
    
    > Sharding, aggregating remote resources, and abstracting complex infrastructure can all be accomplished using virtualization techniques, but they aren’t, of themselves, virtualization.

<br>

7. Which of the following best describes infrastructure‐as‐a‐service products?
    - Services that give you direct control over underlying compute and storage resources

    <br>
    
    > PaaS products mask complexity, SaaS products provide end-user services, and serverless architectures (like AWS Lambda) let developers run code on cloud servers.

<br>

8. Which of the following best describes platform‐as‐a‐service products?
    - Services that hide infrastructure complexity behind a simple interface
    <br>
    
    > IaaS products provide full infrastructure access, SaaS products provide end‐user services, and serverless architectures (like AWS Lambda) let developers run code on cloud servers.

<br>

9. Which of the following best describes software‐as‐a‐service products?
    - Services that provide a service to end users through a public network
    <br>
    
    > IaaS products provide full infrastructure access, PaaS products mask complexity, and serverless architectures (like AWS Lambda) let developers run code on cloud servers.

<br>

10. Which of the following best describes scalability?
    - The ability of an application to automatically add preconfigured compute resources to meet increasing demand
    <br>
    
    > Increasing or decreasing compute resources better describes elasticity. Efficient use of virtualized resources and billing models aren’t related directly to scalability.

<br>

11. Which of the following best describes elasticity?
    - The ability of an application to increase or decrease compute resources to match changing demand
    <br>
    
    > Preconfiguring compute instances before they’re used to scale up an application is an element of scalability rather than elasticity. Efficient use of virtualized resources and billing models aren’t related directly to elasticity.

<br>

12. Which of the following characteristics most help AWS provide such scalable services? (Choose two.)
    - The enormous number of servers it operates
    - Its highly automated infrastructure administration systems
    <br>
    
    > Capitalized assets and geographic reach are important but don’t have a direct impact on operational scalability.
