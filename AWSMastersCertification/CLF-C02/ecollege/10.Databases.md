### AWS Database Services
AWS offers a broad range of databse solutions, categorised as:

| **Database Type** | **AWS Service**                               | **Best For**                                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational**    | Amazon RDS, Aurora                            | Structured data, transactions and business applications   |
| **NoSQL**         | Amazon DynamoDB, DocumentDB, Amazon Keyspaces | High scalability, low-katency, flexible schemas           |
| **In-Memory**     | Amazon ElastiCache (Redis, Memcached)         | Real-time applications, caching, gmaing, leaderboards     |
| **Graph**         | Amazon Neptune                                | Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines  |
| **Time-Series**   | Amazon Timestream                             | IoT applications, event logging, time-series analytics    |
| **Ledger**        | Amazon QLDB                                   | Immutable records for financial and auditing applications |

<br>

### Deciding Between EC2-Hosted and AWS Managed Databases
Business must decide whether to host databases on EC2 instance or use AWS managed services like RDS

#### EC2-Hosted Database (self-managed)
- **Full control** over database configurations
- **Custom database software and versions**
- **Flexibility** for specific performance and security settings

**Requires manual maintenance** (backups, updates, scaling)
**More operational overheal** for managing high availability and security

**Best for:**
* Workloads requiring **custom database configurations**
* **Legacy applications** that need specific database software
* Companies with **database administration expertise**

<br>

### AWS Managed Databases
- **Automatic backups, patching, and maintenance**
- **High availability and scalability build-in**
- **Security features (IAM, encryption, automated failover)**

**Less control over database settings**
**May have higher costs compared to self-managed solutions**

**Best for:**
* Business needing **fully managed, scalable databases**
* Developers who want to **focus on applications rather than infrastructure**
* Companies needing **high availability, disaster recovery and auto-scaling

<br>

### Relational Databases (SQL-Based)
Relational databases store structural data in tables using SQL. AWS offers Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora as managed relational databasesolutions

#### Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
Amazon RDS siplifies the management of relational databases, providing automated backups, security and scalability

| **Feature**                        | **Amazon RDS**                                |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Supported Engines**              | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle SQL Server |
| **Automatic Backups**              | Yes                                           |
| **Multi-AZ for High Availability** | Yes                                           |
| **Read Replicas for Scalability**  | Yes                                           |

**Best for:**
- Traditional web applications
- Enterprise applications that require SQL database
- Data that needs **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)**
