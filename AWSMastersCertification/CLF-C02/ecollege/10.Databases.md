### AWS Database Services
AWS offers a broad range of databse solutions, categorised as:

| **Database Type** | **AWS Service**                               | **Best For**                                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relational**    | Amazon RDS, Aurora                            | Structured data, transactions and business applications   |

<br>

### Deciding Between EC2-Hosted and AWS Managed Databases
Business must decide whether to host databases on EC2 instance or use AWS managed services like RDS

#### EC2-Hosted Database (self-managed)
- **Full control** over database configurations
- **Custom database software and versions**
- **Flexibility** for specific performance and security settings

**Requires manual maintenance** (backups, updates, scaling)
**More operational overheal** for managing high availability and security

**Best for:**
* Workloads requiring **custom database configurations**
* **Legacy applications** that need specific database software
* Companies with **database administration expertise**

<br>

### AWS Managed Databases
- **Automatic backups, patching, and maintenance**
- **High availability and scalability build-in**
- **Security features (IAM, encryption, automated failover)**

**Less control over database settings**
**May have higher costs compared to self-managed solutions**

**Best for:**
* Business needing **fully managed, scalable databases**
* Developers who want to **focus on applications rather than infrastructure**
* Companies needing **high availability, disaster recovery and auto-scaling

<br>
