# Identify AWS Network Services

### Introduction to AWS Netowrking

AWS provides manu networking services, allowing business to design secure, scalable, high-performance cloud architectures. Understanding AWS networking is crucial for:
- **Creating isolated and secure environments** using Amazon VPC
- **Controlling inbloud and outbound traffic** with security groups and network ACLs.
- **Providing scalable DNS and traffic routing** using Amazon Route 53
- **Using edge services for performance improvements**, such as AWS CloudFront and Global Accelerator
- **Establishing private, high-speed netowrk connectivity** using AWS VPN and Direct Connect

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically separated network within AWS where you can define:
- **IP addressing and subnets**
- **Traffic routing and access control**
- **Security policies with firewalls and gateways**

#### Key components of a VPC
A VPC consists of several components that help define its structure and security

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPC**                    | A private cloud network that spans an AWS Region                      |
| **Subents**                | Divide a VPC into smaller segments (Public or Private)                |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Connects the VPC to the public internet                               |
| **NAT Gateway**            | Allows private instances to access the internet without being exposed |
| **VPC Peering**            | Connects two VPCs for private communication                           |
| **Transit Gateway**        | Connects multiple VPC and on-premises network                         |
| **Elastic IPs**            | Static public IPs for instances needing persistent address            |

### Security in VPC
Security in AWS VPC is managed using Security Groups and Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)

#### Security Groups (SG)
- **Act as a virtual firewall** for AWS resources, such as EC2 instances
- **Control inbound and outbound traffic** based on allowed rules
- **Stateful** - if any an inbound rule allows traffic, the outbound response is automatically allowed
- **Assigned at the instance level**

**Example**
- Allow SSH (port 22) access ony for a spacific IP range
- Permit HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic for web servers

<br>

### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- **Act as an additional firewall** at the subnet level
- **Stateless** - Rules must be defined for both inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Control traffic between subnets** (unlike SG, which control instance-level access)

<br>

| **Security Group**                           | **Network ACL (NACL)**                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Assigned to individual instances             | Assigned at the subnet level                |
| Stateful (automatic reponse traffic allowed) | Stateless (rules must allow return traffic) |
| Rules apply only to associated resources     | Rules apply to all resources in a subnet    |
| Best for controlling application access      | Best for restricting subnet-wide traffic    |
