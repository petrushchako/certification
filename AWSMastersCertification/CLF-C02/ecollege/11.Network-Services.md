# Identify AWS Network Services

### Introduction to AWS Netowrking

AWS provides manu networking services, allowing business to design secure, scalable, high-performance cloud architectures. Understanding AWS networking is crucial for:
- **Creating isolated and secure environments** using Amazon VPC
- **Controlling inbloud and outbound traffic** with security groups and network ACLs.
- **Providing scalable DNS and traffic routing** using Amazon Route 53
- **Using edge services for performance improvements**, such as AWS CloudFront and Global Accelerator
- **Establishing private, high-speed netowrk connectivity** using AWS VPN and Direct Connect

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically separated network within AWS where you can define:
- **IP addressing and subnets**
- **Traffic routing and access control**
- **Security policies with firewalls and gateways**

#### Key components of a VPC
A VPC consists of several components that help define its structure and security

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VPC**                    | A private cloud network that spans an AWS Region                      |
| **Subents**                | Divide a VPC into smaller segments (Public or Private)                |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Connects the VPC to the public internet                               |
| **NAT Gateway**            | Allows private instances to access the internet without being exposed |
| **VPC Peering**            | Connects two VPCs for private communication                           |
| **Transit Gateway**        | Connects multiple VPC and on-premises network                         |
| **Elastic IPs**            | Static public IPs for instances needing persistent address            |

<br>

### Security in VPC
Security in AWS VPC is managed using Security Groups and Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)

#### Security Groups (SG)
- **Act as a virtual firewall** for AWS resources, such as EC2 instances
- **Control inbound and outbound traffic** based on allowed rules
- **Stateful** - if any an inbound rule allows traffic, the outbound response is automatically allowed
- **Assigned at the instance level**

**Example**
- Allow SSH (port 22) access ony for a spacific IP range
- Permit HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic for web servers

<br>

### Network ACLs (NACLs)
- **Act as an additional firewall** at the subnet level
- **Stateless** - Rules must be defined for both inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Control traffic between subnets** (unlike SG, which control instance-level access)

<br>

| **Security Group**                           | **Network ACL (NACL)**                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Assigned to individual instances             | Assigned at the subnet level                |
| Stateful (automatic reponse traffic allowed) | Stateless (rules must allow return traffic) |
| Rules apply only to associated resources     | Rules apply to all resources in a subnet    |
| Best for controlling application access      | Best for restricting subnet-wide traffic    |

<br>

### Amazon Router 53 - Scalable DNS Service
Amazon Route 53 is a highly scalable and globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS) service

#### Key Funtions of Route 53
| **Feature**                       | **Purpose**                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain Name Registration**      | Register custom domain names                                        |
| **DNS Routing**                   | Resolves domain names to IP address                                 |
| **Traffic Routing Policies**      | Routes traffic based on latency, geolocation, weighted distribution |
| **Health Checks & Failover**      | Detects unresponsice endpoints and reroutes traffic                 |
| **Integration with AWS Services** | Works with EC2, CloudFront, and Elastic Load Balancer               |

<br>

**Best for** managing domain names, global load galancing, and ensuring high availability

<br>

#### Routing Policies in Route 53

| **Routing Policy**        | **Use Case**                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Routing**        | Directs traffic to a single IP or AWS resource                     |
| **Weighted Routing**      | Distributes traffic across multiple endpoints based on percentages |
| **Latency-Based Routing** | Routes traffic to the region with the lowest latency               |
| **Geolocation Routing**   | Routes users based on their geographical location                  |
| **Failover Routing**      | Redirects traffic if a primary resource becomes unavailable        |

<br>

### AWS Edge Services
AWS offers edge networking services that enhance global applications' performance, security and reliability

#### Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
- **Caches content at the edge locations worldwide** for fast content delivery
- **Reduces latency and bandwidth costs**
- **Supports SSL/TLS encryption** for secure data transfer
- **Protects against DDoS attacks** when integrated with AWS Shield

<br>

### AWS Network Connectivity Options
AWS provides multiple ways to connect on-premises networks with AWS for secure, low-latency communication
#### AWS VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- **Establishes a secure encrypted tunnel** between on-premises and AWS
- **Uses the internet to create a private connection**
- **Supports IPsec encryption** for secure communication

**Best for:**
- Small to medium business needing secure remote access
- Organizations without high-speed direct connections

<br>

#### AWS Direct Connect
AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated, high-speed private connection between on-premises infrastructure and AWS
- **Bypasses the public internet** for lower latency and higher security
- **Provides 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps direct cinnections**
- **More stable and reliable than a VPN**

**Best for:**
- Enterprises requiring high-speed, secure AWS access
