# Identify AWS Storage Services

### Introduction to AWS Storage Services

AWS offers a range of scalable, secure, and cost-effective storage solutions tailored to meed the need of business and applications. There storage services fall into three primary categories:
- **Object Storage** - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Block Storage** - Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage) & Instance Store
- **File Storage** - Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) & Amazon FSx
- **Hybrid and Cached Storage** - AWS Storage Gateway

### AWS Storage Services Overview

| **Storage Type**          | **AWS Service**            | **Best For**                                                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Object Storage**        | Amazon S3                  | Scalable cloud storage for unstructured data (images, videos, backups)  |
| **Block Storage**         | Amazon EBS, Instance Store | High-performance, persistent storage for EC2 instances                  |
| **File Storage**          | Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx     | Shared, scalable file storage for applications and enterprise workloads |
| **Hybrid/Cached Storage** | AWS Storage Gateway        | Extending on-premises storage to AWS                                    |
| **Backup & Archiving**    | AWS Backup, S3 Glacier     | Automated backups and long-term archival storage                        |

### Object Storage: Amazon S3
Amazon S3 is a fully managed, scalable and secure object storage service
- **Stores unstructured data** (images, videos, logs, backups)
- **Each file (object) is stored with metadata and a unique identifier (key)**
- **High scalable** - can store unlimited amounts of data
- **Accessible via HTTP/S, ideal for web applications and backups**

**Best for:**
- Storing static website content (images, HTML, JavaScript)
- Data lakes for big data analytics
- Backups and disaster recovery
- Archival storage with long-term cost savings

#### Amazon S3 Storage Classes

| **Storage Class**                     | **Use Case**                                                     | **Cost Efficiency**                                             |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                       | Frequently accessed data                                         | High availability, low latency                                  |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**            | Automatically moves data between frequently and infrequent tiers | Cost-optimized for unknown access patterns                      |
| **S3 Standad-IA (Infrequent Access)** | Data accessed less frequently but needs quick retrieval          | It is a cheaper than S3 Standard, but retrieval costs apply     |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                    | Lower cost IA storage in a single AZ                             | Suitable for secondary backups but not resilient to AZ failures |
| **S3 Glacier**                        | Long-term archival storage (minutes to hours retrieval)          | Cheapest option for archival storage                            |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**           | Archive data is rately accessed (retrieval in 12+ hours)         | Lower cost for deep archival needs                              |

### Block Storage: Amazon EBS and Instance Store
#### What is Block Storage?
- Designed to high-performance workloads like databases and virtual machines
- Breaks data into blocks, stored separately
- Attached to EC2 instances for persistent storage

#### Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
Amazon EBS provides durable, high-performance storage for Amazon EC2 instances

**Best for:**
- **Boot volumes** for EC2 instances
- **Databases and transactional applications**
- **Big data analytics workloads**

#### EBS Volume Types
| **Volume Type** | **Performance** | **Best For** |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)** | Balanced performance for most workloads | Web servers, app hosting |
| **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2)** | High-performance, low-latency storage | Databases, high-tranaction apps |
| **Thoughput Optimized HDD (st1)** | High-throughput for big data workloads | Large-scale data processing |
| **Cold HDD (sc1)** | Cost-effective storage for infrequent access | Archive storage and backups |
