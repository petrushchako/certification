### AWS Compute Purchasing Options

AWS provides multiple purachasing options for compute resources, mainly for Amazon EC2 instances

| **Pricing Model**          | **Description**                                                          | **Best For**                                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Demand**              | Pay for compute capacity per second or hour with no commitment           | Short-term workloads, development/testing                          |
| **Reserved Instance (RI)** | Commit to 1-year or 3-year terms for discounted pricing                  | Steady-statte workloads with predictable usage                     |
| **Savings Plans**          | Flexible alternative to RIs, offering cost savings with usage commitment | Workloads that need cost reduction without strict instance locking |
| **Spot Instances**         | Use unused AWS compute capacity at up to 90% discount                    | Faoult-tolerant, batch or flexible workloads                       |
| **Dedicated Hosts**        | Physical EC2 server dedicated to customer                                | Regulatory compliance, software licensing needs                    |
| **Dedicated Instance**     | Instance running on hardware dedicated to a single customer              | Security-sensitive workloads needing isolation                     |
| **Capacity Reservations**  | Reserve compute capacity without a long-term commitment                  | Critical applications that require guaranteed availability         |
