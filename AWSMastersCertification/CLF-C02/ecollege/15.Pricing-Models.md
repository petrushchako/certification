# Compare AWS Pricing Models

### Introduction to AWS Pricing Models

AWS offers flexible models that allow businesses to optimise costs based on their workload requirements. Understanding compute pricing options, data transfer charge and storage tiers is essential for cost-effective cloud usage.

##### Key Topics Covered
- **Compute Purchasing Options** - On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, Savings Plans, Dedicated Hosts, and Capacity Reservations
- **Data Transfer Costs** - Understanding inbound and outbound data transfer costs
- **Storage Pricing Models** - Different storage options and cost tiers

### AWS Compute Purchasing Options

AWS provides multiple purachasing options for compute resources, mainly for Amazon EC2 instances

| **Pricing Model**          | **Description**                                                          | **Best For**                                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Demand**              | Pay for compute capacity per second or hour with no commitment           | Short-term workloads, development/testing                          |
| **Reserved Instance (RI)** | Commit to 1-year or 3-year terms for discounted pricing                  | Steady-statte workloads with predictable usage                     |
| **Savings Plans**          | Flexible alternative to RIs, offering cost savings with usage commitment | Workloads that need cost reduction without strict instance locking |
| **Spot Instances**         | Use unused AWS compute capacity at up to 90% discount                    | Faoult-tolerant, batch or flexible workloads                       |
| **Dedicated Hosts**        | Physical EC2 server dedicated to customer                                | Regulatory compliance, software licensing needs                    |
| **Dedicated Instance**     | Instance running on hardware dedicated to a single customer              | Security-sensitive workloads needing isolation                     |
| **Capacity Reservations**  | Reserve compute capacity without a long-term commitment                  | Critical applications that require guaranteed availability         |

### Reserved Instance (RI) Flexibility and AWS Organizations

Reserved Instances provide long-term savings for predictable workloads

| **Type**           | **Flexibility**                                               | **Best For**                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard RI**    | Provides the highest discount but limited flexibility         | Workloads that do not change instance family or region       |
| **Convertible RI** | Allows exchanging for a different instance family, size or OS | Workloads that may need changes over time                    |
| **Scheduled RI**   | Used for workloads that only run as specific times            | Applications that need compute power on a recurring schedule |

#### Reserved Instances in AWS Organizations
- RIs can be shared across accounts within AWS Organizations
- Only the payer account benefits from the discount
- Unused Reserved Instances can be sold on the AWS RI Marketplace

### Data Transfer Charges
AWS charges for data transfers based on source, destination and service type

#### Understanding Incoming and Outgoing Data Transfer Costs

| **Transfer Type**                             | **Pricing**                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inbound to AWS (internet -> AWS)**          | Free (No charge for inbound data)                           |
| **Outbound from AWS (AWS -> Internet)**       | Charged per GB based on the region and amount of data       |
| **Within the Same Region (Between AZs)**      | Charged per GB (e.g., EC2 to EC2 across AZs)                |
| **Cross-Region Transfers (Region to Region)** | Charged per GB (higher cost that same-region transfers)     |
| **Amazon CloudForont Data Transfer**          | Free for inbound data; outbound data is lower cost than EC2 |

<br>

#### How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs
- **Use Amazon CloudFront** - Caches content close to users to reduce outbound data costs
- **Leverage AWS PrivateLink** - Reduces data transfer costs between services
- **Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway** - Avoids cross-AZ charges for inter-VPC traffic
- **Monitor with AWS Cost Explorer** - Identifies expensive data transfer patterns

### AWS Storage Pricing and Tiers

AWS provides different storage options and pricing models depending on access frequency, durability and performance needs

#### Amazon S3 Pricing and Storage Tiers
Amazon S3 pricing depends on storage on stage class, data retrieval and request types

| **Storage Class** | **Best For** | **Cost Efficiency** |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **S3 Standard** | Frequently access to workloads (e.g., websites, mobile apps) | Automatically moves objects between tiers to save costs |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | Data with unpredictable access patterns | Automatically moves objects between tiers to save costs |
| **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** | Data is accessed less frequently but needs fast retrieval | Lower cost, but retrieval fees apply |
| **S3 One Zone-IA** | A lower-cost option for infrequent access data in one AZ | It is cheaper than S3-IA but has less durability |
| **S3 Glacier** | Long-term archival storage (minutes to hours retrieval) | The chepest option for long-term storage |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Rarely accessed data (retrieval in 12+ hours) | Lowest-cost option for long-term archival |


##### Choosing the Right Storage Class:
- Frequently access data? - Use **S3 Standard**
- Unpredictable access patterns? - Use **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**
- Backups and disaster recovery? - Use Standard-IA
- Archival and compliance storage? - Use **S3 Glacier** or **Glacier Deep Archive**
