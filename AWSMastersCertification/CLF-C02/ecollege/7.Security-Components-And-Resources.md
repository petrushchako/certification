### Identifying Security Issues with AWS Tools

AWS provides real-time security monitoring and recommendations to identify risks and improve security posture

#### AWS Services for Identifying Security Issues

| **Service**             | **Function**                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **AWS Trusted Advisor** | Provides security recomendations(e.g. checking for open security groups and unencrypted data) |
| **Amazon GuardDuty**    | It uses AI to detect security threats like unauthorised access or unusual network activity |
| **AWS Security Hub**    | Aggregate security findings from multiple AWS services into a single dashboard |
| **Amazon Macie**        | Detect and classifies sencitive data in Amazon S3 |


> **Using AWS Trusted Advisor**
>
> AWS Trust Advisor automatically scans AWS account for security risks and provides recommendation in areas such as:
> - **IAM Security** - Checks for overly permissive IAM policies
> - **S3 Bucket Permissions** - Identifies publicly accessible storage
> - **EC2 Security Groups** - Detects open ports that may pose security risks
