# Define the AWS Global Infrastructure

### Introduction to AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS operates a highly scalable, secure, globally distributed cloud infrastructure to ensure availability, performance, and resistance. This infrastructure is designed to support high availability, fault tolerance, and low-latency access for users worldwide.

Key components of the AWS global infrastructure:
- **AWS Regions**
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**
- **Edge Locations**
- **AWS Wavelength Zones & AWS Local Zones**
- **High Availability through Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Deployments**

<br>

### AWS Global Infrastructure Components
1. **AWS Regions**<br>An AWS Region is a geographically isolated area that contains multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Each region operates independently, ensuring fault tolerance and compliance with data regions.<br><br>**Key Characteristics of AWS Regions**:
  - **Fully isolated** - Regions operate independently from one another
  - **Contains multiple AZs** - Typically three or more AZs per region
  - **Used for data sovereignty** - Business can comply with local data laws by choosing a specific region
  - **Regional services** - Some AWS services (e.g. Amazon RDS, EC2) operate at the regional level

#### When to Use Multiple AWS Regions
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity** - Deploy applications in multiple regions to avoid downtime
- **Low Latency for End Users** - Choose regions close to users to improve performance
- **Compliance & Data Sovereignty** - Some regulations require data to stau within specific geopolitical boundaries
- **Scalability & Redundancy** - Deloying across multiple regions ensures a more resilient architecture

<br>

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**<br>An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data centre within an AWS Region. Each AZ consists of independent power, cooling, and networking to prevent a single point of failure.<br><br>**Key Characteristics of Availability Zones**:
  - **Each AZ is isolated from failure in other AZs**
  - **Connected to low-latency, high-speed networking**
  - **Sesigned for high availability and fault tolerance**
  - **Used for disaster recovery and failover solutions**

#### **How to Use Availability Zones for High Availability**
- **Deploy applications across multiple AZs** (e.g., use Elastic Load Balancer with EC2 instances in different AZs)
- **Use Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments** for automated failover
- **Distribute workloads with AWS Auto Scaling** to ensure application availability


<br>

1. **Edge Locations**<br>An edge location is a geographically distributed caching point that stores copies of frequently accessed data, enabling low-latency content delivery<br>**Key Benefits of Edge Locations**:
  - **Reduces latency** by caching content closer to end users
  - **Enhances performance** for global applications
  - **Improves security** by filtering malicious traffic before reaching AWS Regions
  - **Used in content delivery networks (CDN)** such as Amazon CloudFront

#### AWS Services That Use Edge Locations
| **AWS Service**            | **Function**                                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon CloudFront**      | Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches data at edge locations |
| **AWS Global Accelerator** | Directs user traffic to the best AWS endpoint for low latency     |
| **AWS Shield**             | Protects against DDoS attacks at edge locations                   |
| **AWS WAF**                | Blocks malicious traffic before reaching AWS resources            |
