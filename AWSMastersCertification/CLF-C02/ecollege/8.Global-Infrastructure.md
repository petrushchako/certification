# Define the AWS Global Infrastructure

### Introduction to AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS operates a highly scalable, secure, globally distributed cloud infrastructure to ensure availability, performance, and resistance. This infrastructure is designed to support high availability, fault tolerance, and low-latency access for users worldwide.

Key components of the AWS global infrastructure:
- **AWS Regions**
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**
- **Edge Locations**
- **AWS Wavelength Zones & AWS Local Zones**
- **High Availability through Multi-AZ and Multi-Region Deployments**

<br>

### AWS Global Infrastructure Components
1. **AWS Regions**<br>An AWS Region is a geographically isolated area that contains multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Each region operates independently, ensuring fault tolerance and compliance with data regions.<br><br>**Key Characteristics of AWS Regions**:
  - **Fully isolated** - Regions operate independently from one another
  - **Contains multiple AZs** - Typically three or more AZs per region
  - **Used for data sovereignty** - Business can comply with local data laws by choosing a specific region
  - **Regional services** - Some AWS services (e.g. Amazon RDS, EC2) operate at the regional level

#### When to Use Multiple AWS Regions
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity** - Deploy applications in multiple regions to avoid downtime
- **Low Latency for End Users** - Choose regions close to users to improve performance
- **Compliance & Data Sovereignty** - Some regulations require data to stau within specific geopolitical boundaries
- **Scalability & Redundancy** - Deloying across multiple regions ensures a more resilient architecture

<br>

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**<br>An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate data centre within an AWS Region. Each AZ consists of independent power, cooling, and networking to prevent a single point of failure.<br><br>**Key Characteristics of Availability Zones**:
  - **Each AZ is isolated from failure in other AZs**
  - **Connected to low-latency, high-speed networking**
  - **Sesigned for high availability and fault tolerance**
  - **Used for disaster recovery and failover solutions**

#### **How to Use Availability Zones for High Availability**
- **Deploy applications across multiple AZs** (e.g., use Elastic Load Balancer with EC2 instances in different AZs)
- **Use Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments** for automated failover
- **Distribute workloads with AWS Auto Scaling** to ensure application availability


<br>

3. **Edge Locations**<br>An edge location is a geographically distributed caching point that stores copies of frequently accessed data, enabling low-latency content delivery<br>**Key Benefits of Edge Locations**:
  - **Reduces latency** by caching content closer to end users
  - **Enhances performance** for global applications
  - **Improves security** by filtering malicious traffic before reaching AWS Regions
  - **Used in content delivery networks (CDN)** such as Amazon CloudFront

#### AWS Services That Use Edge Locations
| **AWS Service**            | **Function**                                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon CloudFront**      | Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches data at edge locations |
| **AWS Global Accelerator** | Directs user traffic to the best AWS endpoint for low latency     |
| **AWS Shield**             | Protects against DDoS attacks at edge locations                   |
| **AWS WAF**                | Blocks malicious traffic before reaching AWS resources            |

<br>

4. **AWS Wavelength Zones & AWS Local Zones**<br>AWS offers specialised infrastructure options for ultra-low-latency applications.

#### AWS Wavelength Zones
AWS Wavelength extends AWS infrastructure to telecom networks to provide low-latency 5G services

- **Used for real-time applications** like AR/VR, IoT and gaming
- **Ensures data stays close to 5G networks** for fast processing

#### AWS Local Zones
AWS Local Zones provide services closer to major cities without AWS Regions
- **Used for latency-sensitive applications** like video streaming, gaming and hybriid workloads
- **Reduces latency by keeping compute and storage resources close to users**
- **Common in industries like media, finance, and healthcare**

| **Feature**           | **AWS Local Zones**                             | **AWS Wavelength**                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Location** | Metropolitan areas (e.g., London, Los Angeles). |	Embedded inside 5G Carrier networks (e.g., Verizon, Vodafone). |
| **The "Bridge"**      | Connected to the local internet and AWS Region. | Connected directly to the 5G core network.                     |
| **Network Exit**      | Standard Internet/Direct Connect.               | Carrier Gateway (traffic never hits the open internet).        |
| **Latency Goal**      | Single-digit ms for any local internet user.    | Single-digit ms specifically for mobile/5G devices.            |
| **Target User**       | Desktop/Office users, Gamers, VFX Artists.      | Mobile Gamers, Autonomous Vehicles, Smart City IoT.            |

### High Availability in AWS
Hight availability (HA) ensures minimal downtime and continuous application operation using fault-tolerant architectures

#### Key strategies for HA:
1. **Use Multiple AZs**
   - Deploy across at least two AZ for redundancy
   - Use Amazon RDS multi-az for database failover
   - Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic
2. **Use Multi-region deployment**
   - Deploy applications in different AWS regions for disaster recovery
   - Use AWS Route 53 for DNS failover to redirect traffic automatically
   - Store backups in multiple regions using Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication
3. **Utilise Auto Scaling**
   - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically adjusts capacity based on demand
   - AWS Lambda provides serverless scaling

### When to Use Mutiple AWS Regions

| **Scenario**            | **Benefit**                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Disaster Recovery**   | Ensure failover in case of regional failure |
| **Business Continuity** | Maintain application uptime during outages  |
| **Low-Latency Access**  | Reduce latency for global users             |
| **Data Sovereignty**    | Meet compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)  |
