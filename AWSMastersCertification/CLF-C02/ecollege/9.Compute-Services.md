# Identify AWS Compute Services

### Introduction to AWS Compute Services
AWS provides various compute services to meet business needs, from virtual machines (EC2), containers, and serverless computing to auto-scaling and load balancing for optimised performance.

Understanding these services allows business to:
- **Scale workloads efficiently** using elstic compute resources
- **Optimize cost and performance** by selecting the appropriate instance ot compute model
- **Use serverless and container-based compute solutions** for event-driven and microservices architectures
- **Improve application availability** using auto-scaling and load balancing

<br>

### AWS Compute Services
AWS offers different compute services categorised as:
- **Vitual Machines (EC2)**
- **Container-Based Compute (ECS, EKS, AWS Fargate)**
- **Auto Scaling for Elasticity**
- **Load Balancers for Traffic Distribution**

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Vitual Machine-Based Compute
Amazon EC2 provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud. Users can choose the instance type, operating system, and networking settings.

#### Key Features of Amazon EC2
- **On-demand computing** - Pay for what you use
- **Multiple instance types** - Optimized for different workloads
- **Elasticity with Auto Scaling** - Scales instances in/out based on demand
- **Custom configurations** - Choose CPU, memory, storage, and networking

#### EC2 Instance Types
AWS provides differnt EC2 instance types, each optimised for specific workloads

| **EC2 Instance Type** | **Purpose**                              | **Example Use Case**                                | **Instance type** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **General Purpose**   | Balanced CPU, memory, and storage        | Web servers, microservices, databases               | `T3`, `M5`        |
| **Compute Optimized** | High CPU performance                     | Gaming, media processing, scientific modelling      | `C5`, `C6i`       |
| **Memory optimized**  | High RAM for memory-intensive tasks      | In-memory databses, real-time analytics             | `R5`, `X2`        |
| **Storage Optimized** | High disk performance for large datasets | Bid data processing, high-performance databases     | `I3`, `D2`        |
| **GPU Optimized**     | High parallel computing power            | Machine learning, deep learning, graphics rendering | `P4`, `G5`        |

### AWS Container-Based Compute Services
Containers package applications with dependencies into a single, portable unit. AWS provides managed container services to simplify deployment

#### AWS Container Services

| **AWS Service**                              | **Description**                                                    | **Best For**                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon ECS<br>Elastic Container Service**  | Fully managed container orchestration for Docker containers        | Running containers at scale without managing servers |
| **Amazon EKS<br>Elastic Kubernetes Service** | Managed Kubernetes service for large-scale containerised workloads | Running Kubernetes clusters on AWS                   |
| **AWS Fargate**                              | Serverless compute for containers - no EC2 instances needed        | Running containers without infrastructure managment  |
