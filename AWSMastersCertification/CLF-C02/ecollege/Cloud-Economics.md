# Understanding Concept of Cloud Economics

1. Introduction to Cloud Economics
   
Cloud economics focuses on the financial benefits of using cloud computing over traditional on-premises infrastructure. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, enabling organisations to optimise costs, increase efficiency, and reduce capital expenditures.

Cloud computing offers several economic advantages, including:
- **Cost savings** through optimised resource usage.
- **Scalability** to match demand and avoid over-provisioning.
- **Operational efficiency** via automation and managed services.


2. Aspects of Cloud Economics

#### On-Premises vs. Cloud Cost Models

| **Cost Factor**            | **On-Premises**                                                | **Cloud (AWS)**                    |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Upfront Investment**     | Requires purchasing servers, storage, and networking equipment | No upfront hardware costs          | 
| **Operational Costs**      | Maintenance, electricity, cooling, staff                       | Pay for what you use               |
| **Scalability**            | Limited; requires additional hardware purchases                | Elastic scaling based on demand    |
| **Utilisation Efficiency** | Over-provisioning leads to wasted resources                    | Right-sizing ensures optimal usage |
| **Maintenance**            | Manual updates and hardware replacements                       | AWS manages infrastructure         |





3. Licensing Strategies in the Cloud

AWS offers different licensing models to optimise software costs:


| **Licensing Model**               | **Description**                                               | **Example Use Case**                                  |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** | Allows organizations to use existing software licenses in AWS | Migrating licensed database like Microsoft SQL Server |
| **Included License**              | AWS provides the software license as part of the service      | Running Amazon RDS with built-in SQL Server licensing |
| **Subscription-Based License**    | Pay for software on a usage basis                             | Amazon WorkSpace for Windows virtual desktops         |
