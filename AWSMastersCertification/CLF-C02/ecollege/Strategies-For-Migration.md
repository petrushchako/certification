# Understanding the Benefits of and Strategies for Migration to the AWS Cloud

Cloud migration involves moving digital assets, applications and data from on-premises infrastructure to AWS Cloud. Organizations migrate to AWS to enhance scalablility, security, cost efficiency, and business agility. AWS provides structured migration strategies and tools to ensure smooth cloud adoption, minimising downtime and maximising performance.

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
The AWS CLoud Adoption Framwork helps organization develop a migration strategy by addressing key aspects of cloud adoption. It is structured into six perspectives, each focusing on specific organizational needs:

| **Perspective** | **Focus Area**                                  | **Key Benefits**                                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Business**    | Business value, ROI, Cloud benefits             | Increased revenue, agility and innovation         |
| **People**      | Workforce transformation                        | Upskilling teams, fostering cloud expertise       |
| **Governance**  | Compliance, risk management, policy enforcement | Ensures regulatory compliance, security policies  |
| **Platform**    | Infrastructure, architecture optimisation       | Scalable, resilient cloud environments            |
| **Security**    | Data protection, risk management                | Strong security posture, automated compliance     |
| **Operations**  | Monitoring, automation, reliability             | Improved operational efficiency, reduced downtime |


#### Benefits of AWS Cloud Adoption (AWS CAF Advantages)
1. **Reduced Business Risk**<br>Improved security, compliance, and resilience reduce IT-related risks.
2. **Improved ESG Performance**<br>Energy-efficient data centers and reduced carbon footprints contribute to sustainability goals.
3. **Increased Revenue**<br>Faster time-to-market and innovation enable organisations to generate more revenue.
4. **Increase Operational Efficiency**<br>Automation, monitoring, and optimised workflows improve productivity.

### AWS Cloud Migration Strategies
AWS offers multiple strategies for migrating workloads to the cloud. The **6 R's Migration Model** outlines six key approaches:

| **Migration Strategy**                  | **Description**                                     | **Example Use Case**                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**             | Moving applications without changes                 | Legacy applications requiring quick migration                          |
| **Replatform (Lift, Tinker and Shift)** | Making minor optimisations during migration         | Moving a database to Amazon RDS instead of self-managed                |
| **Refactor (Re-architect)**             | Rebuilding applications to cloud-native             | Converting a monolitic app into microservices using AWS Lambda         |
| **Repurchase**                          | Replacing existing applications with SaaS solutions | Moving from self-hosted email to Mazon WorkMail                        |
| **Retire**                              | Decomissioning unnecessary workloads                | Removing outdated applications to reduce costs                         |
| **Retain**                              | Keeping certain workloads on-premises               | Keeping sensistive regulatory workloads on-prem while migrating others |
