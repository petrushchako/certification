## AWS Marketplace Security Products
- **Key Exam Tip**: Understand that purchasing a third-party security tool from AWS Marketplace can enhance the security of an AWS architecture.
- **Remember**: For questions about introducing additional security, consider AWS Marketplace as an option for sourcing third-party security solutions.

<br><br><br>

## IAM Refresh
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Understand IAM basics: users, groups, and roles, and how they grant access.
  - Recognize that IAM provides centralized control over an AWS account.
  - Be aware of IAM features like Identity Federation, MFA, temporary access, password policies, integration, and compliance.

<br><br><br>

## MFA
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):**  
  - Adds a second layer of security for AWS accounts.  
  - Can be enabled for both root and IAM user accounts.  
  - Works with both the AWS console and CLI.  

- **Credential Report:**  
  - Lists all IAM users in the account.  
  - Includes details like password age, access key age, and MFA status.  
  - Useful for auditing and ensuring compliance with security best practices.  

<br><br><br>


## Introducing IAM Identity Center
- **Federated Identity:**  
  - Authentication across multiple systems using a single identity.  

- **IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO):**  
  - Centrally manages identity federation and SSO in AWS.  

- **Active Directory Integration:**  
  - **AD Connector:** Simplifies integration with on-premises AD.  
  - **AD Trust Relationship:** Configures trust between on-premises AD and AWS Directory Service.  

<br><br><br>


## Auditing and Troubleshooting Access Issues
- **CloudTrail:**  
  - Logs API activity and stores events in S3 or CloudWatch Logs.  
  - Use with Athena for advanced querying.  

- **IAM Access Analyzer:**  
  - Identifies externally shared resources.  
  - Key services include S3, Lambda, IAM roles, and Secrets Manager.

   - All services/actions denied by default.
   - Specify the allowed services and actions explicitly.
2. **Deny List:**
   - All services/actions allowed by default.
   - Specify the denied services and actions explicitly.
3. **Purpose:**
   - SCPs are used to control and manage access to AWS services.
   - Default strategy is deny list, but allow lists are also supported.
4. **Hierarchy:**
   - SCPs apply to OUs and their child accounts.
   - SCP inheritance must be understood to avoid access issues.

<br><br><br>


## Securing Multiple Accounts with AWS Control Tower and Organizations

<br><br><br>


## AWS Key Management Service vs AWS Certificate Manager
**Key Points to Remember**
1. **ACM vs. KMS**:
    - **ACM**: Manages SSL/TLS certificates for websites and services.
    - **KMS**: Manages cryptographic keys for data encryption and secure operations.
2. **KMS Key Sizes**:
    - KMS uses AES-256 encryption for data keys, which is very strong and suitable for modern encryption needs.
    - While not directly comparable to PGP keys, the cryptographic strength of KMS keys is sufficient for enterprise-grade security.
3. **Integration**:
    - KMS integrates seamlessly with AWS services, while ACM focuses on HTTPS and identity verification.

<br><br><br>


## Differentiating Dedicated Instance vs Dedicatet Hosts
1. **Dedicated Instances**:
   - Reserved physical hardware for EC2 instances but only a portion of the server.
   - Instances are **physically isolated** from those in other accounts.
   - Billing is **per instance**.

2. **Dedicated Hosts**:
   - Provides full control over the entire server.
   - Suitable for **compliance-heavy environments**.
   - Supports **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.
   - Billing is **per host**.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - **Dedicated Instances**: Space on a server, automatic placement, and shared hardware across the same account.
   - **Dedicated Hosts**: Entire server, manual placement, and supports regulatory compliance.

<br>

Both options provide **dedicated hardware**, but the choice depends on the level of control and compliance required for your application.

<br><br><br>
