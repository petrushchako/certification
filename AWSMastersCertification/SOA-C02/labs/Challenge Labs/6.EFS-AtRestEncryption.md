# Configure At Rest Encryption for EFS

![](../../img/ChallengeLab-6.png)

<br>

### ABOUT THIS LAB
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) provides incredible scalability for your storage requirements, making it easy to share data across hundreds or even thousands of EC2 instances. In this lab, you will create an Amazon Elastic File System in the us-east-1 Region with encryption enabled. You will also configure mount targets for this file system, enforce encryption in flight, and finally, mount the file system to a pre-created EC2 instance.

### Objectives
- Create an EFS File System Named devshare with Encryption Enabled
- Create a Mount Target for EFS Using EFSMountSecurityGroup
- Apply a File System Policy to the EFS Volume to Enforce In-Transit Encryption for All Clients
- Mount the EFS Volume to the EC2 Instance and Create a File on the Elastic File System
