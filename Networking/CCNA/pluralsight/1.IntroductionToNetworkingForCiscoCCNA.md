# Introduction to Networking for Cisco CCNA

### Description 
In this course, Introduction to Networking for Cisco CCNA, you will examine how basic human communication, like talking in person or on the phone, contains the same fundamental concepts used in moving data across a network. 

First, you will learn how to examine communication, and determine how to dissect it into components so it can be individually categorized and described. 

Next, you will learn how to break down communication into components, which will be of great benefit when understanding data networking, as there are many simple protocols which interact in complex ways. 

To accomplish this you will learn the TCP/IP and OSI models of networking, encapsulation, addressing, as well as what is called "chunks of information" at different points in the communication process. 

Finally you'll learn about the history and the birth of high speed data communications. By the end of this course, you'll know the OSI Model, TCP/IP Model, and you'll have an understanding of what encapsulation is as it relates to data networking.

## A Brief History of Moving Information
### Introduction to Networking
**Definition**
* Networking is the process of transferring information between two or more parties.
* Communication can be direct (spoken words) or via various transmission methods.

**Basic Communication Process**
1. **Message Creation** – Formulate the concept (e.g., “What time is it?”).
2. **Encoding** – Convert the concept into a form suitable for transmission (spoken language, written symbols, electrical signals).
3. **Transmission Medium** – Physical or non-physical path for data (air, paper, wires).
4. **Decoding** – Receiver interprets the encoded message back into its original meaning.

**Historical Communication Methods and Networking Principles**

| Method | Mechanism | Limitation | Key Networking Concept Introduced |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Speech** | Air vibrations from vocal cords | Short distance | Encoding/decoding using language |
| **Mail** | Written symbols on paper | Slow delivery | Physical delivery of information  |
| **Pony Express** | Horses carrying messages | Limited speed | Faster transport of physical data |
| **Telegraph** | Electrical pulses (Morse Code: dots/dashes) over wires | Manual encoding/decoding needed | Signal conversion over a medium |
| **Telephone** | Voice vibrations converted to electrical signals | Distance limited by wiring | Real-time signal transmission |

**Key Evolution Steps**
- **Telegraph** – Converted language into Morse Code (electrical pulses) and transmitted over wires.
- **Telephone** – Converted voice vibrations directly into electrical signals for transmission and then back to sound.
- **Email/Internet** – Uses digital encoding of messages, transmitted across complex interconnected networks.

**Core Networking Principle**

-  Data networking involves **translating a message from one form to another**, transmitting it over a medium, and **converting it back** for the receiver.

## Dissecting Communication
### Local And Global Addressing
- **Local Addressing**:
  - Names (e.g., “Homer” or “Marge”) act as local identifiers in the same environment.
  - Ensures correct communication within a local scope (e.g., at a party).
- **Global Addressing**:
  - Phone numbers act as unique global identifiers.
  - Enables communication across distances, not just within the same room.

**Communication Process Using Global Addressing (Phone Call Example)**
1. **Setup Phase (Protocol Overhead)**
   - Pick up phone, wait for dial tone, dial number, wait for ringing.
   - Receiver answers, initial greetings exchanged.
   - These steps establish communication but do not transfer actual data.
2. **Conversation (Data Exchange)**
   - The actual content: messages, questions, responses (e.g., “How was your day?”).
   - Represents the meaningful data transfer.
3. **Cues (Control Information)**
   - Maintain and regulate communication.
   - Examples:
     - *Acknowledgements*: “Uh huh”, “I see”.
     - *Errors*: “You’re breaking up”, “Please repeat”.
     - *Termination*: “Goodbye”, “See you later”.

**Media (Transmission Mediums)**
- **Air** – carries spoken language via sound waves.
- **Wires** – carry electrical signals converted from voice by the telephone.

**Five Categories of Networking Concepts (Party/Phone Analogy)**
1. **Local Address** – Name (used for communication in the same environment).
2. **Global Address** – Phone number (used for long-distance communication).
3. **Cues** – Setup, acknowledgements, error handling, termination.
4. **Data** – Actual content of the conversation.
5. **Media** – The physical medium that carries the signals (air, wires, etc.).

**Key Principle**
- Networking requires **addressing**, **protocols (cues)**, **data exchange**, and a **transmission medium**. These foundational elements map directly to how computer networks operate.

### Protocols and Communication Models
**Definition of a Protocol**
- A **protocol** is a set of rules used to move information between two parties (people or devices).
- In data communications, protocols ensure that information is transmitted, received, and understood correctly.
- Picking up the phone, waiting for a dial tone, dialing the number, and waiting for ringing are all part of the **phone communication protocol**. If these rules aren’t followed, the connection fails.

**Common Networking Protocols**
- **Ethernet** – Protocol for wired LAN communication.
- **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)** – Secure file transfers.
- **HTTP / HTTPS** – Web communication protocols.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – Provides addressing and routing.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – Fast, connectionless communication.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** – Routing protocol for exchanging information between networks.

> **Protocol Complexity**
> 
> Individual protocols are relatively simple.
> **Complexity arises from their interactions** (e.g., TCP/IP stack, web traffic using multiple layers).

**Role of Communication Models**
- A **communication model** organizes the process of data transfer into components.
- Helps break down complex networking interactions into structured layers.
- Makes it easier to analyze, understand, and troubleshoot networks.
