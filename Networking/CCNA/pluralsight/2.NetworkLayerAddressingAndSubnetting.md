## Introduction to Binary
### Module Goals
- Understand **why binary numbering is necessary** in networking.
- Review **primary school math concepts** to build intuition for binary.
- Learn **how to count in binary (base 2)**.
- Practice **conversions**:
  - Binary > Decimal
  - Decimal > Binary
- Introduce **Hexadecimal** and its role in networking.

### Purpose
- Binary and hexadecimal provide the foundation for understanding **IPv4 and IPv6 addressing**.
- These concepts are essential before diving deeper into **IP addressing and subnetting** in data networking.

## Binary 101
### Base 10 (Decimal System)
- The **decimal system (base 10)** is the numbering system humans commonly use.
- Digits range from **0–9** (10 unique values).
- Placeholders increase by powers of 10:
  - Ones (10⁰), Tens (10¹), Hundreds (10²), Thousands (10³), etc.
- Example:
  - After `9`, we must add a new placeholder → `10`.
  - After `99`, we add the hundreds placeholder → `100`.
- This system likely evolved from humans having **10 fingers and toes**.

### Base 2 (Binary System)
- **Binary (base 2)** is the numbering system used by computers.
- Digits range from **0–1** (two unique values).
- Placeholders increase by powers of 2:
  - Ones (2⁰), Twos (2¹), Fours (2²), Eights (2³), Sixteens (2⁴), etc.
- Counting in binary works the same way as decimal but with only 0s and 1s:
    ```YAML
    0000 = 0
    0001 = 1   (1s place → turned on)
    0010 = 2   (2s place → turned on)
    0011 = 3   (2 + 1)
    0100 = 4   (4s place → turned on, 1s and 2s reset to 0)
    0101 = 5   (4 + 1)
    0110 = 6   (4 + 2)
    0111 = 7   (4 + 2 + 1)
    1000 = 8   (8s place → turned on, everything else reset to 0)
    ```

### Key Insight
- Each new placeholder in **binary doubles the value** of the previous one.
- This makes binary ideal for computers since they operate with **on/off (1/0) states**.


<br><br><br>

## Converting Binary to Decimal
Binary numbers can be easily converted into decimal values by using **placeholders**.

### Placeholders
- Start from the rightmost bit with value **1** (the 1s place).
- Each step to the left doubles the value: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.

### Conversion Method
1. Write the binary number.
2. Write placeholder values above each bit.
3. For every bit that is **1**, multiply it by its placeholder value.
4. Add up all the results.

### Examples
- ![](img/2.1.BinaryToDecimalConversion.png)<br><br>
- **11000000** → 128 + 64 = **192**
- **10110** → 16 + 4 + 2 = **22**
- **01000110** → 64 + 4 + 2 = **70**
- **11001000** → 128 + 64 + 8 = **200**
- **11100001** → 128 + 64 + 32 + 1 = **225**
  
### Key Point
You only add the placeholders where the binary digit is **1**.
With practice, binary-to-decimal conversion becomes quick and intuitive, which is essential for understanding IP addressing and subnetting.
