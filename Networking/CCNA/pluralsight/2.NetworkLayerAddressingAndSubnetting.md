## Introduction to Binary
### Module Goals
- Understand **why binary numbering is necessary** in networking.
- Review **primary school math concepts** to build intuition for binary.
- Learn **how to count in binary (base 2)**.
- Practice **conversions**:
  - Binary > Decimal
  - Decimal > Binary
- Introduce **Hexadecimal** and its role in networking.

### Purpose
- Binary and hexadecimal provide the foundation for understanding **IPv4 and IPv6 addressing**.
- These concepts are essential before diving deeper into **IP addressing and subnetting** in data networking.

## Binary 101
### Base 10 (Decimal System)
- The **decimal system (base 10)** is the numbering system humans commonly use.
- Digits range from **0–9** (10 unique values).
- Placeholders increase by powers of 10:
  - Ones (10⁰), Tens (10¹), Hundreds (10²), Thousands (10³), etc.
- Example:
  - After `9`, we must add a new placeholder → `10`.
  - After `99`, we add the hundreds placeholder → `100`.
- This system likely evolved from humans having **10 fingers and toes**.

### Base 2 (Binary System)
- **Binary (base 2)** is the numbering system used by computers.
- Digits range from **0–1** (two unique values).
- Placeholders increase by powers of 2:
  - Ones (2⁰), Twos (2¹), Fours (2²), Eights (2³), Sixteens (2⁴), etc.
- Counting in binary works the same way as decimal but with only 0s and 1s:
  - `0`
  - `1`
  - `10` (binary for decimal 2)
  - `11` (binary for decimal 3)
  - `100` (binary for decimal 4)
  - `101` (binary for decimal 5)
  - `110` (binary for decimal 6)
  - `111` (binary for decimal 7)
  - `1000` (binary for decimal 8), and so on.

### Key Insight
- Each new placeholder in **binary doubles the value** of the previous one.
- This makes binary ideal for computers since they operate with **on/off (1/0) states**.
