# Demo:<br>Modify and Test IP Configuration

### 1. Two PCs on the Same Network
- **PC1:** `192.168.10.10` / `255.255.255.0`
- **PC2:** `192.168.10.100` / `255.255.255.0`

Result:
- `ping 192.168.10.100` succeeds.
- Both devices share the same **network prefix (192.168.10.0/24)**, so they can communicate directly.
- No default gateway is needed because no router is present.

### 2. Two PCs on Different Networks (No Router)
- **PC1:** `192.168.11.10` / `255.255.255.0`
- **PC2:** `192.168.10.100` / `255.255.255.0`

Result:
- `ping 192.168.10.100` fails → *PING: transmit failed. General failure.*
- Reason: Network prefixes are different (`192.168.10.0/24` vs. `192.168.11.0/24`).
- Without a router to route between networks, direct communication is impossible.

### 3. Using a Larger Subnet Mask
- **PC1:** `192.168.11.0` / `255.255.254.0`
- **PC2:** `192.168.10.100` / `255.255.254.0`

Result:
- `ping 192.168.10.100` succeeds.
- Why? The mask `/23 (255.255.254.0)` means the first **23 bits** are the **network prefix**.
- Both IPs belong to the same network:
  - `192.168.10.0 – 192.168.11.255`
- Even though `.11.0` *looks* like a network address in decimal, binary analysis shows the host portion is not all zeros → it is valid as a **host address**.

### Key Takeaways
1. Devices must share the same **network prefix** to communicate directly.
2. Changing the subnet mask changes the definition of the network boundary.
3. An IP ending in `.0` is not always a network address—it depends on the mask.
4. Without a router (default gateway), traffic cannot cross from one network to another.

## Expanding existing network (Clarification to result #3)

Currently the network is `192.168.1.0/24` (≈254 hosts). With 200 hosts already and 300 new users coming, `/24` is too small.
To fit \~500 hosts, we must expand to a `/23` (≈510 hosts). This combines four contiguous /24 networks:

- `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.1.255`

### Key Point
The **IP addresses of existing hosts do not change**, but their **subnet mask must change** from `/24` (`255.255.255.0`) to `/22` (`255.255.254.0`).
The **gateway interface** must also be updated to `/23`.

### Why this is needed
If some devices keep `/24` while others use `/23`, they will disagree on which hosts are “local.” This causes ARP failures and broken communication.

### Fix
1. Update the **gateway/router** interface from `/24` → `/23`.
2. Update **DHCP scope** to hand out the new `/23` mask.
3. Reconfigure **static hosts** with the new mask.
4. Verify connectivity — now all devices (`192.168.0.x` to `192.168.1.x`) can talk directly without routing.
