# Demo:<br>Configure IPv6 Address Statically

### 1. Initial Setup – Link-local Only
- By default, macOS automatically assigns a **link-local IPv6 address** to each active interface.
- Check your current configuration:

  ```bash
  ifconfig en0
  ```

  Example output:

  ```
  en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
          ether ae:4b:4a:a4:ab:17
          inet6 fe80::10da:80e6:335c:b94%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0xb
          inet 192.168.1.27 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255
          nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
          status: active
  ```
- Here, the **`inet6 fe80::...`** entry is the link-local IPv6 address.
- Once a router with IPv6 enabled is present on the network, it sends **Router Advertisements (RA)**. These allow your Mac to learn the router’s **link-local address**, which can then be used for testing connectivity.

### 2. Testing Link-local Communication
- You can ping the router’s link-local address:

  ```bash
  ping6 fe80::1%en0
  ```

  - `ping6` forces IPv6 ICMP.
  - `%en0` specifies the interface (required for link-local addresses).
- If successful, this confirms IPv6 link-local communication is working between your Mac and the router.
