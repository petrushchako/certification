# Subnetting Example 1:<br>11 Locations with 10.0.50.0/24

### Problem
- Organization has **11 locations**.
- ISP provided: **10.0.50.0/24**
- Goal: Create enough subnets for 11 locations.

### Step 1 – Requirements
- **Needed networks:** 11
- From subnet calculator (Networks column):
  - 2^3 = 8 (too few)
  - 2^4 = 16 (enough, covers 11)
- Therefore, **borrow 4 bits**.

### Step 2 – New Subnet Mask
- Original mask: **/24 = 255.255.255.0**
- Borrow 4 bits → **/28 = 255.255.255.240**
- Leaves **4 host bits**.

### Step 3 – Host Calculation
- Host bits = 4
- Hosts = 2^4 – 2 = **14 usable hosts per subnet**

### Step 4 – Subnet Increments
- Block size = 2^4 = 16
- Subnets increment by **16** in the 4th octet.
