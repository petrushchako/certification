# CompTIA Network+ exam questions

## Chapter 1: Introduction to networks

1. Which network type is locally owned and managed by an organization and used to connect the organization’s LAN together?
    - **CAN** 
        > A campus area network (CAN) is a connectivity method that is locally owned and managed by an organization to connect multiple LANs together. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a connectivity method used in a metropolitan area, but it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A wide area network (WAN) is a connectivity method that is used for connectivity in a wide area, and it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices within an extremely close vicinity.
2. Which network topology design has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices?
    - **Star topology** 
        > A star topology, also known as hub‐and‐spoke topology, has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices outward like a star. A full mesh topology allows for a decentralized switching design, where any link failure will not affect switching. A partial mesh topology is normally performed between the layers of core, distribution, and access to allow for a single link failure while maintaining switching services. A hybrid topology is where several different topologies are employed, such as star and mesh.
3. Which protocol can be typically found inside a PAN?
    - **Bluetooth** 
        > Bluetooth is a common networking protocol found inside a personal area network (PAN) connecting personal devices. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is a technology that uses labels to switch packets. A software‐defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services. A virtual NIC (vNIC) is used to connect a virtual machine (VM) to a virtual switch (vSwitch).
4. When computers are logically grouped on a LAN based upon a functional department in the organization, what is the group called?
    - **Workgroup** 
        > A workgroup is a logical grouping of computers on a local area network (LAN) based upon a department’s function. A backbone is the connectivity method that connects multiple network segments together. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects multiple buildings together in close proximity. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices together in close proximity often using Bluetooth technology.
5. Which is the primary benefit to using a star topology?
    - **Easy to troubleshoot** 
        > A benefit to the star topology is that it is easy to troubleshoot since each host has its own connection. Equal access is typically a benefit of ring topologies. Bus topologies are typically the simplest network in terms of design, whereas star networks can have redundancy, loops, and many other complex design considerations. Redundancy is not found in star topologies; it is typically in mesh networks.
6. What type of logical connection does MPLS create to connect networks together?
    - **Circuit** 
        > A circuit is the logical connection that MPLS creates to connect networks together. A peer‐to‐peer connection is a bidirectional logical connection for sharing files and accessing files. A client‐server connection is another logical connection created for accessing information in one direction from client to server. East‐west is a term used to describe traffic within the same network or data center.
7. Which type of network is used exclusively for storage traffic?
    - **SAN** 
        > A storage area network (SAN) is a network that is used exclusively for storage traffic. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects buildings together in close proximity. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that connects clients within a metropolitan area, such as a city, together. A local area network (LAN) is a network within a building or residence that connects hosts together.
8. Which type of traffic flow is routed from your internal network to the Internet?
    - **North-South** 
        > North‐south traffic flow describes the flow of information from an internal network to the Internet or other routed destination. East‐west traffic is kept within the internal network or data center and not routed. Wide area network (WAN) and metropolitan area (MAN) network describe a general network type, not traffic flow or a specific connection.
9. Which topology incorporates some redundancy of equipment and connections to provide fault tolerance but is not completely fault‐tolerant?
    - **Hybrid** 
        > A mesh topology incorporates redundancy in the form of switches and redundant connections to provide complete fault tolerance to the network design. When a mesh topology is combined with the star (hub‐and‐spoke) topology, it creates a hybrid topology that allows for fault‐tolerant design at a lower cost than a full mesh topology. Ring and bus topology are susceptible to total network failure if there is a failure anywhere in the network.
10. Which topology should be selected if you have a central office that needs to communicate with several branch offices for WAN connectivity?
    - **Point‐to‐multipoint** 
        > A point‐to‐multipoint topology should be selected if a central office needs to connect with several branch offices. Popular point‐to‐multipoint connection technologies are frame relay and MPLS, to name a few. A point‐to‐point connection is typically used to connect two offices together. Mesh and bus topologies are not used for WAN connectivity.
11. Which network architecture allows for access or sharing of resources in a network by the same host?
    - **Peer‐to‐peer** 
        > Peer‐to‐peer is a network architecture that allows the same host to both access and share resources in a network. Client‐server network architecture strictly defines the client that will access the information and the server that shares the information. Local area network (LAN) is a network type and not related to sharing information. Hybrid topology describes a topology that incorporates two or more topologies.
12. Which is the major advantage of client‐server network architecture?
    - **Centralized management** 
        > The major advantage to a client‐server network architecture is the ability to have centralized management. Distributed security is not applicable to client‐server network architecture and is found in a peer‐to‐peer network architecture. The client‐server relationship is rigid and not very flexible. Equal access is an attribute of peer‐to‐peer network architecture.
13. You are setting up a network connection that requires redundancy in the event a switch or single link fails. Which topology should you select?
    - **Mesh** 
        > A mesh topology is used for redundancy and protects a network in the event of a switch or link failure. Bus and ring topologies are very susceptible to failure and require a fully functioning network. A star topology by itself does not offer redundancy in the event of failure.
14. Where is the full mesh topology commonly seen in the three‐tier design model?
    - **Distribution layer** 
        > Distribution layer switches are fully meshed for redundancy. The core layer is normally implemented with a star topology. The access layer is normally implemented with a partial mesh topology or hybrid topology. Routing layer is not a valid term in the three‐tier design model.
15. Which connectivity method is used within a small geographic area to connect an organization together?

        > A virtual switch (vSwitch) is used to connect multiple VMs together. A hypervisor is software that allows the sharing of the compute, network, and storage of a physical host or group of hosts that have direct access to these resources. A load balancer is used to distribute the load for a network service. A network function virtualization (NFV) is a function that is virtualized, such as a router or firewall, to name a few.
17. When you tether a cell phone to your laptops using wireless, what is this an example of?
    - **PAN** 
        > A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices within an extremely close vicinity, such as a cell phone to a laptop. A storage area network (SAN) is used exclusively for storage connectivity. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network type used in a metropolitan area to connect an organization together.

11. Which concept describes transmitting multiple segments before the receiving host acknowledges the data?
    - **Windowing** 
        > The concept of transmitting multiple segments before the receiving host acknowledges the data is windowing. Sequencing is done with each segment so they can be combined back together at the Transport layer. Compression and encryption are found at the Presentation layer, and neither is the correct answer.
   
12. Which device will stop broadcasts from propagating the network?
    - **Router** 
        > By default, a router will stop broadcasts from propagating the network. A switch, hub, and wireless access point (WAP) will not stop broadcasts from propagating the network.
   
13. Which is used to determine the best path to a destination network?

## Chapter 4: The Current Ethernet Specifications
1. Which contention method does 802.3 Ethernet use for collisions?
    - **CSMA/CD** 
        > Ethernet uses carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) as the main contention method for collisions with half‐duplex communications. Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used with 802.11 wireless communications as the main contention method for collisions. Half‐duplex mode requires a contention method since the same pair is used for transmitting and receiving bits. Full‐duplex mode does not require a contention method for collisions since there is a dedicated pair of wires for transmitting and a dedicated pair of wire for receiving bits.
2. Which field in an Ethernet frame is used to check the integrity of the frame?
    - **FCS** 
        > The frame checking sequence (FCS) is a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) calculation used to check the integrity of the frame. The start of frame (SOF) delimiter is a one‐byte field of alternating 1s and 0s that signifies the start of the frame. The preamble allows the other physical connection to synchronize its clocks for the data that follows. The destination address (DA) is the destination MAC address the frame is destined for.
3. What is the significance of the preamble?
    - **The preamble allows the switch to sync timing for the receipt of information to follow.** 
        > The preamble allows for the source computer to sync its timing of the physical media–independent interface with the destination computer. It achieves this via an alternating 1 and 0 pattern at a specific frequency depending on data transfer speed. The SFD has an extra bit to let the destination computer know anything that follows is data.
4. In a layer 2 frame, where is the destination MAC address?
    - **The destination MAC address is the first 6 bytes after the preamble** 
        > The 6‐byte destination MAC address is after the preamble/SFD so that it can be read by the switch for forwarding. All other answers are incorrect.
5. How many bits is the OUI assigned by the IEEE?
    - **24 bits** 
        > The organizationally unique identifier (OUI) is 24 bits or the first 3 bytes of the MAC address.
6. If the I/G or Individual/Group bit is set to 1 in the OUI portion of the MAC address, which statement is true?
    - **The MAC address is a broadcast or multicast** 
        > When the I/G bit is set, it means that the MAC address is intended to be a broadcast or multicast for a group of recipients. All other answers are incorrect.
7. If the L/G or Local/Group bit is set to 1 in the OUI portion of the MAC address, which statement is true?
    - **The MAC address is locally governed** 
        > When the L/G bit (sometimes referred to as the U/L bit) is set, it means the MAC address is locally governed. This means the user has manually set the MAC address. All other answers are incorrect.
8. Which is a reason that the Ethernet protocol uses physical addresses?
    - **It uniquely identifies devices at layer 2** 
        > MAC addresses are physical addresses that are burnt into every NIC card and network device. It is unique at the data link layer from direct communication purposes. All other answers are incorrect.
9. What is the 2‐byte type field used for in an Ethernet frame?
    - **It identifies the upper‐layer protocol for the data contained within the frame.** 
        > The Ethernet type field is 2 bytes, and it identifies at layer 2 which upper‐layer protocol to send the data to. When IPv4 is used, the type field is 0x0800. When IPv6 is used, the type field is 0x86dd. All other answers are incorrect.
10. What is the purpose of the State of Frame delimiter byte in a frame?
    - **It provides a means for the receiving node to know when data begins.** 
        > The preamble is 7 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s at a frequency that matches the bandwidth of the link. It is important to note that the 1s and 0s pattern starts with a 1 and ends with a 0 for 7 bytes (10101010). The SFD has an extra lower bit signaling the end of timing and the start of data (10101011). All other answers are incorrect.
11. How many bits are in a nibble?
    - **4** 
        > There are 4 bits in a nibble. A single bit is the lowest value in the binary system, with a potential value of 0 or 1. There are 8 bits in a byte or octet, depending on the base value. 16 bits is a double byte, also called a word.
12. How many bits are in a MAC address?
    - **48** 
        > There are 48 bits that compose a MAC address. 24 bits are assigned by the Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to the organization. The other 24 bits are assigned by the organization for uniqueness. All other answers are incorrect.
13. You need to connect a fiber‐optic line between two floors of a building that are 200 meters apart. Which Ethernet technology is the most cost effective that will accomplish the task?
    - **10GBaseSR** 
        > 10GBaseSR will support 10 Gb/s for a maximum distance of 300 meters. 10GBaseLR will support 10 Gb/s up to 10 kilometers and will provide ample connectivity between buildings. 10GBaseER will operate at 10 Gb/s for a total of 40 kilometers. 10GBaseT will support 10 Gb/s over copper UTP cables for a maximum distance of 100 meters. Although 10GBaseER and 10GBaseLR can accomplish the task, these technologies are much more expensive than 10GBaseSR.
14. Which technology provides Internet connectivity over power lines?
    - **BPL** 
        > Broadband over Power Line (BPL) called IEEE 1901 is a technology that provides Internet connectivity over power lines. Multimedia over Coax (MoCA) is a technology that provides network connectivity over coaxial lines. HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video, audio, and data streams into a single HDMI cable. HomePlug is a technology that allows you to run local area network (LAN) traffic in your home, over your home’s power line.
15. Which statement is true when a collision is detected on the network?
    - **A jam signal is sent to all hosts on the segment.** 
        > When a collision occurs, a jam signal is sent to all hosts on the segment to notify them of the collision. A random backoff algorithm will take effect, after which all hosts will have equal priority to transmit again. All other answers are incorrect.
16. How many bits are used to represent the hexadecimal value of 0x0020?
    - **16** 
        > The hexadecimal value of 0x0020 contains 16 bits. Each digit is a hexadecimal value, and there are 4 digits that trail the 0x hex identifier. Each digit has 4 bits and 4 digits × 4 bits = 16 bits. All other answers are incorrect.
17. Which 3 bytes of the Media Access Control (MAC) address F3‐B2‐CD‐E4‐F4‐42 designate the unique station identifier?
    - **E4‐F4‐42** 
        > The last 3 bytes, E4‐F4‐42, of the Media Access Control (MAC) address designate the unique station identifier. The first 3 bytes, F3‐B2‐CD, are the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). All other answers are incorrect.
18. Which protocol does a host use to find the hardware address of a neighbor host by using the destination IP address?
    - **ARP** 
        > Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to find the MAC address of another host on the same LAN. On an Ethernet network, the MAC address (hardware address) is used for one host to communicate with another. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are both Transport layer protocols used to transmit segments. The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is used for name resolution.
19. What are the speed, maximum distance, and media of 10GBaseT?
    - **10 Gb/s, 100 meters, and copper** 
        > The Ethernet specification of 10GBaseT is 10 Gb/s with a maximum distance of 100 meters over copper. All other answers are incorrect.
20. How many wire pairs are used with 1000BaseTX?
    - **Four** 
        > 1000BaseTX uses two pairs of wires, one pair for transmitting and one pair for receiving. All other answers are incorrect.

## Chapter 5: Networking Devices
1. You have been asked to change the IP address in external DNS for a mail server in your organization. Which record can be changed with the least amount of effort?
   - **A record** 
        > The alias, or A, record that matches the MX record configured for the mail server should be changed. If you were to change the MX record, a new alias record would need to be created as well, since every MX record contains the FQDN that maps to an alias record. A PTR record is used for reverse DNS and will not solve the problem. A TXT record is used to resolve plaintext and does not solve the problem.
2. Which is a valid reason to implement a wireless LAN controller?
    - **Centralized provisioning** 
        > Centralized provisioning of lightweight wireless access points (LWAPs) is a valid reason to implement a WLAN controller. Although a wireless LAN controller makes it easier to implement multiple SSIDs and VLANs, this task can be performed with autonomous WAPs, each performing its own authentication. The use of autonomous WAPs negates the reasons you would use a WLAN controller because each WAP would be independently managed and no coordination would exist between the autonomous WAPs. The use of multiple SSIDs can be achieved with an autonomous WAP without a WLAN controller. Multiple VLANs can also be used with an autonomous WAP without a WLAN controller.
3. What is the benefit of network segmentation?
    - **Increased broadcast domains** 
        > Network segmentation increases the number of broadcast domains. This effectively decreases the number of broadcasts seen on a network segment and effectively increases bandwidth. All other answers are incorrect.
4. Which protocol and port do you need to configure on the inbound host‐based firewall for a DHCP server?
    - **UDP/67** 
        > The DHCP server waits for connection from clients on UDP/67; the clients will send the requests from UDP/68. Therefore, the inbound host‐based firewall should be configured to accept traffic from UDP/67.
5. Which type of device will detect but not prevent unauthorized access?
    - **IDS**
        > An IDS, or intrusion detection system, will detect unauthorized access. However, it will not prevent unauthorized access. It is a form of audit control in a network. A firewall will protect your network from attack by placing rules defining how people can connect as well as which traffic can pass. An intrusion protection system (IPS) will detect the presence of an intrusion and alert an administrator. A honeypot will attract a malicious user so that their tactics can be observed. It performs this function by diverting the malicious user from production systems to the honeypot, which is a sacrificial system.
6. Your organization expects a considerable amount of traffic to your web server, so you plan to install several web servers. How can you maintain one FQDN and allow customers to be directed to the next free web servers?
    - **Load balancer** 
        > A load balancer will direct a user’s request to the next free web server. A router will only route traffic to a destination network. A firewall would not accomplish the requirement of distribution of the load. A proxy is something that might fetch the web page on the web server, but it will not provide load balancing.
7. Your organization has deployed several autonomous WAPs. Users complain that they consistently drop the wireless connection when roaming. What should you recommend to resolve this issue?
    - **Wireless LAN controller** 
        > Autonomous WAPs do not have any coordination between them for roaming clients. When a client roams from one WAP to another, they must reauthenticate, and this causes a drop. Implementing a wireless LAN controller will coordinate roaming clients and not require reauthentication.
8. You need to make sure that a printer is configured with the same IP address every time it is turned on. However, the printer is too troublesome to configure a static IP address. What can be done to achieve the goal?
    - **Configure a DHCP reservation for the printer.** 
        > A DHCP reservation will allow for the printer to obtain the same IP address every time it is turned on. The DHCP server will serve the same IP address to the printer based on the printer’s MAC address in the reservation. Configuring an A record will not achieve the goal. Configuring a DHCP exclusion for the printer would work only if you had already set it to a static IP address and didn’t want that IP address assigned to another host. Configuring an PTR record will not achieve the goal.
9.  Which record type is used for an IPv4 address mapping to FQDN for DNS queries?
    - **The PTR record** 
        > The PTR, or pointer record, is used to look up IP addresses and return FQDNs that are mapped to them. This is helpful to identify an IP address, and in the case of SSH, it is used to positively identify the host you are connecting to. The A record is used to look up an IP address for a given hostname. The CName record is used to look up the alias for a given hostname. The AAAA record is used to look up an IPv6 address for a given hostname.
10. Which device will act as a multiport repeater in the network?
    - **Hub** 
        > A hub will act as a multiport repeater by repeating the physical bits on an incoming port to all the other connected ports. A switch or bridge will forward the frame only to the port it is destined for. Even when broadcasts are received, the frame is still processed and not blindly repeated. A WAP acts similarly to a switch and will forward frames only to the connected wireless or wired network.
11. Which is a correct statement when hubs are replaced with switches?
    - **The replacement increases collision domains.** 
        > The replacement of hubs with switches increases collision domains and effectively increases bandwidth. The replacement of switches with hubs can decrease the number of collision domains, creating a much larger collision domain. The replacement of hubs with switches has no effect on broadcast domains. Broadcast domains would be affected only if a router was introduced.
12. When firewalls are placed in a network, which zone contains Internet‐facing services?
    - **Demilitarized zone** 
        > The demilitarized zone (DMZ) or screen subnet is where Internet‐facing servers/services are placed. The outside zone is where the public Internet connection is connected, and it is the least trusted. The enterprise network zone is considered the inside zone. The inside zone is considered to be the highest trusted network because it is the internal network that you control.
13. Which is a false statement about firewalls?
    - **Firewalls are commonly deployed to protect a network from internal attacks.** 
        > Firewalls are not commonly deployed to provide protection from internal attacks on internal resources. They are designed to protect networks from external attacks or attacks emanating from the outside or directed toward the Internet. Firewalls normally provide stateful packet inspection. Firewalls can also control application traffic by port number and higher‐layer attributes.
14. Which statement is correct about reverse lookups?
    - **A reverse lookup is the resolution of an IP address to FQDN.** 
        > A reverse lookup is when the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is resolved from an IP address. This is useful when you want to identify an IP address. From the IP address, you can derive the FQDN. A reverse lookup is not when the request needs to be reversed to another DNS server. A reverse lookup is not when the DNS queried can answer the request without asking another DNS server. A reverse lookup is not the resolution of an FQDN to an IP address; it is the resolution of an IP address to an FQDN.
15. What gets appended to hostname queries for DNS resolution?
    - **The DNS suffix** 
        > The configured DNS suffix is appended to the hostname query. As an example, if you query a hostname of hosta and the configured domain name is network.local, the DNS server will see a query for hosta.network.local. The DNS zone is the database of records contained in DNS. Host header is a term used with web servers and therefore not relevant to DNS resolution. The hostname PTR record is the reverse DNS record for a given IP address.
16. Which type of DNS record holds the IPv4 IP address for a hostname?
    - **The A record** 
        > The A record is the DNS record that is queried when you want to resolve a hostname to an IP address. The CName record is used to look up the alias for a given hostname. The PTR, or pointer record, is used to look up IP addresses and return FQDNs that are mapped to them. The AAAA record is used to look up an IPv6 address for a given hostname.
17. Which of the following devices can work at both layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model?
    - **Multilayer switch** 
        > A multilayer switch can provide both routing and switching capabilities since it operates on layers 2 and 3. A hub is a device that operates only on layer 1. A switch or bridge is a layer 2 device that segments the network.
18. What is an advantage of using DHCP in a network environment?
    - **Automatically assigns IP addresses to hosts** 
        > An advantage to DHCP in a network environment is that it automatically assigns IP addresses to hosts. There is minimal difficulty to administrate DHCP, and this is not considered a benefit. Static IP addressing is used in lieu of a DHCP. DHCP does not send an operating system to a PC, but it can direct it to do so with DHCP options.
19. What is a benefit to installing a proxy server?
    - **Web caching** 
        > Web caching is a tremendous benefit to employing a proxy server. Commonly accessed web pages will be cached, and subsequent requests will be returned locally from the proxy server. The throughput for the network will not increase. DHCP services will not be provided with a proxy server, only the proxying of web pages. Support for user authentication is not a benefit of employing a proxy server.
20. Which protocol and port number does DNS use for direct queries?
    - **UDP/53** 
        > Domain Name System (DNS) direct queries are performed over the UDP protocol to port 53. The queries do not require the TCP setup and teardown because the queries are simple request and reply messages, so UDP is used for direct queries. TCP port 53 is used for DNS zone transfers between DNS servers. UDP port 55 is not used for any popular protocols. UDP port 68 is used with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

## Chapter 6: Introduction to the Internet Protocol
1. Which is a correct statement about the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?
    - **TCP allows for retransmission of lost segments.** 
        > TCP is a connection‐based protocol via the three‐way handshake. It is not faster than UDP. However, it allows for the retransmission of lost segments because of sequences and acknowledgments. TCP does not allow or account for error correction, only the detection of errors and lost or missing segments.
2. How does TCP guarantee delivery of segments to the receiver?
    - **Sequence and acknowledgment numbers** 
        > TCP guarantees delivery of segments with sequence and acknowledgment numbers. At the Transport layer, each segment is given a sequence number that is acknowledged by the receiver. The source and destination ports are used for the delivery of segments, but they do not guarantee delivery. TCP checksums are used to detect errors in segments but do not guarantee delivery. Window size is used to adjust buffer size on the sending and receiving hosts.
3. When a programmer decides to use UDP as a transport protocol, what is a decision factor?
    - **Redundancy of acknowledgment is not needed.** 
        > When a programmer decides to use UDP, it is normally because the programmer is sequencing and acknowledging datagrams already. The redundancy of acknowledgments at the Transport layer is not needed. Guaranteed delivery of segments is not a function of UDP. UDP does not provide windowing flow control because acknowledgment is not a function of UDP. A virtual circuit can be created only with a setup and teardown of communications, such as TCP offers.
4. Which mechanism allows for the Transport layer to communicate with the Session layer?
    - **Port numbers** 
        > Port numbers allow the Transport layer to communicate with the Session layer. An example is a web server binding to the port number of TCP/80. A port is communicated in the header of TCP and UDP segments, but the header does not listen for requests or bind. MAC addresses are physical locations on a local area network (LAN) that are used to transmit framed data. Checksums are used to verify that data are not erroneously modified in transit.
5. Why does DNS use UDP for queries?
    - **DNS requests are usually small and do not require connections setup** 
        > DNS requests are usually small and do not require the overhead of sequence and acknowledgment of TCP. If a segment is dropped, the DNS protocol will ask again. Acknowledgment of data is not a function of UDP. Flow control is not a function of UDP since UDP does not offer flow control of data other than a stop/go action. UDP does not build temporary virtual circuits; this is a function of TCP.
6. Which protocol requires the programmer to deal with lost segments?
    - **UDP** 
        > User Datagram Protocol (UDP) does not guarantee segments are delivered. Therefore, the programmer must account for segments that are never received or out of order. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol used to encrypt a network transmission. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today. Transmission allows for the network to automatically deal with lost segments because TCP guarantees segments are delivered. Network management station (NMS) is a term used with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to describe the collecting host for SNMP messages.
7. Which protocol can encapsulate many different protocols inside an IP tunnel?
    - **GRE** 
        > Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate many protocols inside an IP tunnel. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is used to obtain an IP address from a MAC address. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used by the Network layer to obtain a MAC address from an IP address. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used by the Network layer to communicate network information such as Ping, Traceroute, and many other information services.
8. Which protocol provides confidentiality?
    - **ESP** 
        > Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is used by IP Security Protocol (IPSec) for the confidentiality of the payload. The AH protocol provides authentication for the data and the IP header of a packet using a one‐way hash for packet authentication. Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate many protocols inside an IP tunnel. The protocol data unit (PDU) is a way to describe the data at each layer of the OSI model.
9.  Which protocol is used for configuration access to network appliances but is not encrypted?
    - **Telnet** 
        > Telnet is used for configuration access to network appliances, but it is not encrypted. Secure Shell (SSH) has become the successor of Telnet, since it is encrypted and provides configuration access. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a secure method to transfer web pages. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft protocol that provides a secure method to access a server desktop.
10. Which protocol is used by applications that need low overhead at the Transport layer?
    - **UDP** 
        > The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport layer protocol that provides applications with low overhead. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection‐oriented protocol and has higher overhead. The Internet Protocol (IP) is a Network layer protocol. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is Network layer helper protocol that resolves MAC addresses from a known IP address.
11. Which layer in the DoD model is directly related to the Transport layer of the OSI model?
    - **Host‐to‐Host layer**
        > The Host‐to‐Host DoD layer is directly related to the Transport layer of the OSI model. The Process/Application DoD layer is related to the Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model. The Internet DoD layer is related to the Network layer of the OSI model. The Network Access DoD layer is related to the Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI model.
12. Which element is used with TCP to provide a virtual circuit?
    - **Port numbers**
        > Port numbers are used to create a virtual circuit with TCP. The port numbers are open and in use during the entire TCP conversation. Sequence and acknowledgment numbers are used to assure data is delivered. Protocol numbers are used to direct communications to the next respective upper layer.
13. Which protocol uses UDP/123?
    - **NTP**
        > The Network Time Protocol (NTP) operates on the UDP protocol, port 123. The Trivial File Transfer Protocol operates on the UDP protocol, port 69. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) operates on the TCP protocol, port 443. The Domain Name Service protocol operates on UDP or TCP, port 53.
14. What is the process called when data moves up the OSI model?
    - **Internet layer**
        > The Internet DoD layer is directly related to the Network layer in the OSI model, which is responsible for the logical addressing of hosts. The Process/Application layer is where most networked applications will operate on the Application, Presentation, and Session layers in the OSI model. The Host‐to‐Host DoD layer is directly related to the Transport layer in the OSI model, which is responsible for segmenting data and transporting it. The Network Access DoD layer is directly related to the Data Link and Physical OSI layers. 
15. What is the process called when data moves up the OSI model?
    - **Decapsulation**
        > Data decapsulation is the process of moving data up the OSI model back up to the receiving application. Data encapsulation is the process of moving data down the OSI model to be transmitted on the network. The Frame Checking Sequence (FCS) is a cyclical redundancy check (CRC0) that is processed on the data at the Data Link layer to validate a frame of data. The protocol data unit (PDU) is the reference to the type of data as it passes up and down the OSI layers.
16. Which protocol provides an IP address from a physical address?
    - **RARP**
        > The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) provides an IP address from a physical MAC address. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) works at the Network layer and is used by IP for many different services. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a Transport layer protocol for segmenting and transporting data. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) provides a MAC address from an IP address.
17. What protocol from the Internet Protocol (IP) stack is used for diagnostics and error messages?
    - **ICMP**
        > Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for diagnostics (ping and traceroute) and for sending error messages through the network. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a Transport layer protocol for segmenting and transporting data. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) provides a MAC address from an IP address. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport layer protocol used to send segments of data.
18. Which IP service uses the UDP protocol?
    - **DHCP**
        > The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) operates on UDP port 67 and UDP port 68. The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) operates on TCP port 25. The File Transport Protocol (FTP) operates on TCP ports 20 and 21. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) operates on TCP port 80.
19. You need to make sure that the time is consistent across all your network devices. What protocol do you need to run on your network?
    - **NTP**
        > The Network Time Protocol (NTP) helps synchronize your computer clock over the Internet with the help of an NTP server. The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) allows you to transfer files across the network. The Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is used when transferring files over an encrypted connection. The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol sets up a secure console session over a standard TCP/IP connection.
20. Which of the following allows a server to distinguish among different simultaneous requests from the same host?
    - **They use different port numbers.**
        > Through the use of port numbers, TCP and UDP can establish multiple sessions between the same two hosts without creating any confusion. The sessions can be between the same or different applications, such as multiple web‐browsing sessions or a web‐browsing session and an FTP session. The IP address that the request originates from does not distinguish among different simultaneous requests. Servers are able to accept multiple simultaneous sessions from the same host. The sequence and acknowledgment numbers do not distinguish among different simultaneous requests from the same host.

## Chapter 7: IP Addressing
1. Which of the following addresses is not allowed on the Internet?
    - 191.192.168.1
    - 191.168.169.254
    - 172.32.255.0
    - **172.31.12.251**
        > The addresses in the range 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255 are all considered private, based on RFC 1918. Use of these addresses on the Internet is prohibited so that they can be used simultaneously in different administrative domains without concern for conflict. These addresses are not and should not be routable on the public Internet.

2. A host automatically configured with an address from which of the following ranges indicates an inability to contact a DHCP server?
    - 169.254.0 × with a mask of 255.255.255.0
    - **169.254xx with a mask of 255.255.0.0**
        > The Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) uses the link‐local private address range of 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255 and a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. APIPA addresses are used by DHCP clients that cannot contact a DHCP server and have no static alternate configuration. These addresses are not Internet routable and cannot, by default, be used across routers on an internetwork.
    - 169.254.× × with a mask of 255.255.255.0
    - 169.255 xx with a mask of 255.255.0.0
3. Which statement regarding private IP addresses is most accurate?
    - Private addresses cannot be used in intranets that require routing.
    - Private addresses must be assigned by a registrar a or ISP.
    - **A remote host across the Internet cannot ping your host if it has a private address.**
        > Private IP addresses are not routable over the Internet, as either source or destination addresses. Therefore, any entity that wants to use such addresses internally can do so without causing conflicts with other entities and without asking permission of any registrar or service provider. Despite not being allowed on the Internet, private IP addresses are fully routable on private intranets.
    - Private addresses can be used only by a single administrative domain.
4. Which of the following is a valid Class A address?
    - 191.10.0.1
    - 127.10.0.1
    - 128.10.0.1
    - **126.10.0.1**
        > The Class A range is 1 through 126 for the first octet/byte. The Class B range is 127 through 191 for the first octet/byte. Class C range is 192 through 223 for the first octet/byte.
5. Which of the following is a valid Class B address?
    - 10.1.1.1
    - 126.1.1.1
    - **129.1.1.1**
        > The Class B range is 128 through 191 in the first octet/byte. The Class A range is 1 through 126 for the first octet/byte. Class C range is 192 through 223 for the first octet/byte.
    - 192.168.1.1
6. Which of the following describes a broadcast address?
    - All network bits are on (1s).
    - **All host bits are on (1s).**
        > If you turned on all host bits (all of the host bits are 1s), this would be a broadcast address for that network. Turning all the network bits to 1s would define a different network address. Turning all the network bits to 0s would make the network address invalid. Turning all the host bits to 0s would make the address invalid, as well, since this is how the network is defined.
    - All network bits are off (Os).
    - All host bits are off (0s).
7. Which of the following is a layer 2 broadcast?
    - FF.FF.FF.EE.EE.EE
    - **FF.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF**
        > A layer 2 broadcast is also referred to as a MAC address broadcast, which is in hexadecimal and is FF.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF. A layer 3 broadcast would have a destination address of 255.255.255.255.
    - 255.255.255.255
    - 255.0.0.0
8. In a Class C IP address, how long is the network address?
    - 8 bits
    - 16 bits
    - **24 bits**
        > A default Class C subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which means that the first three octets, or first 24 bits, are the network number.
    - 32 bits
9.  Which of the following is true when describing a unicast address?
    - **Packets addressed to a unicast address are delivered to a single interface.**
        > Packets addressed to a unicast address are delivered to a single interface. For load balancing, multiple interfaces can use the same address.
    - These are your typical publicly routable addresses, just like regular publicly routable addresses in IPv4.
    - These are like private addresses in IPv4 in that they are not meant to be routed.
    - These addresses are meant for nonrouting purposes, but they are almost globally unique, so it is unlikely they will have an address overlap.
10.  A host is rebooted, and you view the IP address that it was assigned. The address is 169.123.13.34. Which of the following happened?
    - The host received an APIPA address.
    - The host received a multicast address.
    - **The host received a public address.**
        >  I wonder how many of you picked APIPA address as your answer? An APIPA address is 169.254.x.x. The host address in this question is a public address. This was somewhat of a tricky question if you did not read carefully.
    - The host received a private address.
11.  An IPv4 address uses 32 bits. How many bits is an IPv6 address?
    - **128**
12.  Which of the following is true when describing a multicast address?
    - **Packets are delivered to all interfaces identified by the address. This is also called a one‐to‐many address.** 
        > Packets addressed to a multicast address are delivered to all interfaces identified by the multicast address, the same as in IPv4. A multicast address is also called a one‐to‐many address. You can tell multicast addresses in IPv6 because they always start with FF.
13.  Which of the following is true when describing an anycast address?
    - **This address identifies multiple interfaces, and the anycast packet is delivered to only one address: the closest one. This address can also be called one‐to‐nearest.** 
        > Anycast addresses identify multiple interfaces, which is the same as multicast; however, the big difference is that the anycast packet is delivered to only one address: the first one it finds defined in terms of routing distance. This address can also be called one‐to‐one‐of‐many or one‐to‐nearest.
14.  You want to ping the loopback address of your local host. Which two options could you type? (Choose two.)
    - **The loopback address with IPv4 is 127.0.0.1. With IPv6, that address is ::1.**
15.  What two statements about IPv6 addresses are true? (Choose two.)
    - Leading zeros are required.
    - **Two colons (::) are used to represent successive hexadecimal fields of zeros.**
    - Two colons (::) are used to separate fields.
    - **A single interface will have multiple IPv6 addresses of different types.**
        > To shorten the written length of an IPv6 address, successive fields of zeros may be replaced by double colons. In trying to shorten the address further, leading zeros may also be removed. Just as with IPv4, a single device’s interface can have more than one address; with IPv6, there are more types of addresses, and the same rule applies. There can be link‐local, global unicast, and multicast addresses all assigned to the same interface.
16.  What two statements about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are true?
   - **IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and are represented in decimal format. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and represented in hexadecimal format.**
17.  Which of the following is a Class C network address?
    - 10.10.10.0
    - 127.0.0.1
    - 128.0.0.0
    - **192.255.254.0**
        >  Only option D is in the Class C range of 192 through 224. It might look wrong because there is a 255 in the address, but this is not wrong—you can have a 255 in a network address, just not in the first octet.
18.  Which of the following are private IP addresses? (Choose two.)
    - 12.0.0.1
    - 168.172.19.39
    - **172.20.14.36**
    - 172.33.194.30
    - **192.168.24.43** 
        > The Class A private address range is 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255. The Class B private address range is 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255, and the Class C private address range is 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255.
19.  IPv6 unicast routing is running on the Corp router. Which of the following addresses would be used as the EUI‐64 address?
        ```sh
        Corp#sh int f0/0
        FastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up
        Hardware is AmdFE, address is 000d.bd3b.0d80 (bia 000d.bd3b.0d80)
        [output cut]
        ```

- FF02::3c3d:0d:bdff:fe3b:0d80
- **FE80::3c3d:2d:bdff:fe3b:0d80**
   > This can be a hard question if you don’t remember to invert the 7th bit! Always look for the 7th bit when studying for the exam. The EUI‐64 autoconfiguration inserts an FF:FE in the middle of the 48‐bit MAC address to create a unique IPv6 address.
- FE80::3c3d:0d:bdff:fe3b:0d80
- FE80::3c3d:2d:ffbd:3bfe:0d80

20.  Which of the following is an invalid IP address for a host?
    - 10.0.0.1
    - 128.0.0.1
    - **224.0.0.1**
    - 172.0.0.1
        > The IP address of 224.0.0.1 is a multicast address and cannot be used to address hosts. The IP address of 10.0.0.1 is a valid IP address for a private host. The IP address of 128.0.0.1 is a valid IP address for a public host. The IP address of 172.0.01 is a valid IP address for a public host.

## Chapter 8: IP Subnetting, Troubleshooting IP, and Introduction to NAT
1. Which is true of the IP address 135.20.255.255?
    - **It is a broadcast address.** 
        > The IP address 135.20.255.255 is a Class B broadcast address. It is not a Class A address, nor is it the default gateway address. The default mask of a Class B address is 255.255.0.0.
2. You have been given an IP address network of 203.23.23.0. You are asked to subnet it for two hosts per network. What is the subnet mask you will need to use to maximize networks?
    - **255.255.255.252** 
        > The mask you will need to use is 255.255.255.252. This will allow for two hosts per network for a total of 64 networks. The formula for solving for hosts is 2^X – 2 is equal to or greater than 2(hosts), which in this case is (22 – 2) = (4 – 2) = 2. So 2 bits are used for the host side, leaving 6 bits for the subnet side. 6 bits + 24 bits (original subnet mask) = /30, or 255.255.255.252. All of the other answer options are incorrect.
3. You require the subnetting of the network address 192.168.1.0 to allow for 10 hosts per subnet while maintaining the maximum number of subnets. What should the subnet mask be?
    - **255.255.255.240** 
        > The subnet mask of 255.255.255.240 will allow for 14 hosts per subnet and a maximum of 16 subnets. No other answer options are correct.
4. You have been assigned a network ID of 131.44.0.0/16 by your ISP. Your organization needs to use this network ID over four campuses. What mask should be used to subnet it to achieve the goal while maximizing host IP addresses?
    - **255.255.192.0** 
        > The network ID granted to your organization is a Class B address, in which the last 16 bits can be subnetted. Using the formula of 2 to the power of 2 gives you a perfect result of 4. Using 2 bits for the subnet mask would make the subnet mask 255.255.192.0 (128 + 64 = 192). This would leave you with 14 bits for further subnetting or host IDs.
5. What is the CIDR notation for a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0?
    - **/20** 
        > The CIDR notation for 255.255.240.0 is /20. The first two subnets are 8 bits (8 × 2 = 16), and the 240 is 4 more bits (16 + 4 = 20). All of the other options are incorrect.
6. You have been given an IP address network of 213.43.53.0. You are asked to subnet it for 22 hosts per network. What is the subnet mask you will need to use to maximize networks?
    - **255.255.255.224** 
        > The mask you will need to use is 255.255.255.224. This will allow for 30 hosts per network for a total of 8 networks. The formula for solving for hosts is 2X – 2 is equal to or greater than 2 hosts, which in this case is (25 – 2) = (32 – 2) = 30. So 5 bits are used for the host side, leaving 3 bits for the subnet side. 3 bits + 24 bits (original subnet mask) = /27, or 255.255.255.224. All of the other answer options are incorrect.
7. Which valid IP is in the same network as 192.168.32.61/26?
    - **192.168.32.59** 
        > The valid IP address range for the 192.168.32.0/26 network is 192.168.32.1 to 192.168.32.62, 192.168.32.65 to 192.168.32.126, etc. Therefore, 192.168.32.59 is within the valid IP range of 192.168.32.61/26. 192.168.32.63 is the broadcast address for the 192.168.32.0/26 network. 192.168.32.64 is the network ID for the 192.168.32.64/26 network. 192.168.32.72 is a valid IP address in the 192.168.32.64/26 network.
8. You are setting up a network in which you need 15 subnetworks. You have been given a network address of 153.20.0.0, and you need to maximize the number of hosts in each network. Which subnet mask will you use?
    - **255.255.240.0** 
        > The subnet mask will be 255.255.240.0. Since you need to solve for the number of networks, the equation is as follows: 2^X is equal to or greater than 15 networks. 2^4 = 16 completed the equation; the 4 bits represent the subnet side; you add the 4 bits to the 16 bits of the class B subne

        | Subnet # | Network (CIDR) | First usable | Last usable   | Broadcast     |
        |:--------:|----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
        | 1        | 153.20.0.0/20	| 153.20.0.1   | 153.20.15.254 | 153.20.15.255 |
        | 2	       | 153.20.16.0/20	| 153.20.16.1  | 153.20.31.254 | 153.20.31.255 |
        | 3        | 153.20.32.0/20	| 153.20.32.1  | 153.20.47.254 | 153.20.47.255 |
        | 4        | 153.20.48.0/20	| 153.20.48.1  | 153.20.63.254 | 153.20.63.255 |
        | 5        | 153.20.64.0/20	| 153.20.64.1  | 153.20.79.254 | 153.20.79.255 |

9.  An ISP gives you an IP address of 209.183.160.45/30 to configure your end of the serial connection. Which IP address will be on the ISP side?
    - **209.183.160.46/30** 
        > The valid IP address range for 209.183.160.45/30 is 209.183.160.45–209.183.160.46. Both IP addresses are part of the 209.183.160.44/30 network. The IP address 209.183.160.47/30 is the broadcast address for the 209.182.160.44/30 network. The IP address 209.183.160.43/30 is the broadcast IP address for the 209.183.160.40/30 network.
10. In the following exhibit, what needs to be changed for Computer A to successfully communicate with Computer B (assume the least amount of effort to fix the problem)?<br>
    ![](img/8.10.MCQ.jpeg)
    - **The default gateway IP address for Computer A needs to be changed.** 
        > The default gateway address for Computer A is 192.168.1.63. The IP address on the router (default gateway) is the broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/26 network and cannot be used as that network’s gateway. If you were to change Computer A’s IP address, it would still not be able to communicate with Computer B because of the incorrect gateway address. Computer B’s IP address and default gateway are fine, and both will function properly.
        ```txt
        Network 1: 192.168.1.0     – 192.168.1.63
        Network 2: 192.168.1.64    – 192.168.1.127
        Network 3: 192.168.1.128   – 192.168.1.191
        Network 4: 192.168.1.192   – 192.168.1.255
        ```
11.  In the following exhibit, what needs to be changed for Computer A to successfully communicate with Computer B (assume the least amount of effort to fix the problem)?
    ![](img/8.11.MCQ.jpeg)
    - **Computer A needs to have its IP address changed.** 
        > Computer A needs to have its IP address changed to align with the network that its gateway is in. Computer A is in the 192.168.1.32/27 network, while its gateway address is in the 192.168.1.0/27 network. Although changing the gateway address would work, the solution needs to be the one with the least amount of effort. Changing the gateway address, which is a valid IP address, would create more work for other clients. Computer B’s IP address and default gateway are fine, and both will function properly.
12.  Which subnet does host 131.50.39.23/21 belong to?
    - **131.50.32.0/21** 
        > The /21 subnet mask has subnets in multiples of 8. So the networks would be 131.50.8.0/21, 131.50.16.0/21, 131.50.24.0/21, 131.50.32.0/21, and 131.50.40.0/21. The IP address of 131.50.39.23/21 would belong to the 131.50.32.0/21 network with a valid range of 131.50.32.1 to 131.50.39.254. Therefore, the network 131.50.39.0/21 cannot be a network ID because it belongs to the 131.50.32.0/21 network. Both the 131.50.16.0/21 and 131.50.8.0/21 network IDs are outside of the range for the host used in this question.
13.  A computer has an IP address of 145.50.23.1/22. What is the broadcast address for that computer?
    - **145.50.23.255** 
        > The network for the computer with an IP address of 145.50.23.1/22 is 145.50.20.0/22. Its valid range is 145.50.20.1 to 145.50.23.254; the broadcast address for the range is 145.50.23.255. All of the other answer options are incorrect.
14.  Which method will allow you to use RFC 1918 addresses for Internet requests?
    - **NAT** 
        > Network address translation (NAT) was created to slow the depletion of Internet addresses. It does this by translating RFC 1918 privatized addresses to one or many public IP addresses. It allows the packets to masquerade as the public IP address on the Internet until it is translated back to the private IP address. Classless Inter‐Domain Routing (CIDR) is a notation used to express the network for a host. Classful addressing is the original addressing scheme for the Internet. Virtual private networks (VPNs) are used for remote access.
15.  In the following exhibit, what is the inside local IP address?
    ![](img/8.15.MCQ.jpeg)
    - **192.168.1.2 Host A** 
        > The inside local address is the address local to the enterprise (private), and the address is inside the enterprise. The inside local address will almost always be an RCF 1918 address, unless NAT is being used for purposes other than enterprise Internet access. If NAT is used for Internet access, then the inside local address is any host address destined for the Internet through NAT. 192.168.1.1 is the router’s interface address used to communicate with inside local hosts during the NAT process. 179.43.44.1 is the inside global address for the NAT process. 198.23.53.3 is the outside global address for the NAT process.
16.  In the following exhibit, what is the inside global IP address?
    ![](img/8.15.MCQ.jpeg)
    - **179.43.44.1 Router A S0/0**
        >  The inside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address is inside of or controlled by the enterprise. The inside global address in this case is the public side of the NAT, which is Router A’s S0/0 IP address. 192.168.1.2 is the inside local address of the host computer. 192.168.1.1 is the router’s interface address used to communicate with inside local hosts during the NAT process. 198.23.53.3 is the outside global address for the NAT process.
17.  In the following exhibit, what is the outside global IP address?
    ![](img/8.15.MCQ.jpeg)
    - **198.23.53.3 web server** 
        > The outside global address is the address public to the enterprise. The address is outside of the enterprise or outside of its control. When using NAT for Internet access, the outside global address is the destination host on the Internet. The outside global address in this exhibit is the web server. 192.168.1.2 is the inside local address of the host computer. 192.168.1.1 is the router’s interface address used to communicate with inside local hosts during the NAT process. 179.43.44.1 is the inside global address for the NAT process.
18.  What is the maximum number of IP addresses that can be assigned to hosts on a local subnet that uses the 255.255.255.248 subnet mask?
    - **6** 
        > A /29 (255.255.255.248) is 5 bits for the network mask and 3 bits for the hosts. This provides 32 subnets, each with 6 hosts. Does it matter if this mask is used with a Class A, B, or C network address? Not at all. The number of host bits would never change.
19.  If a host on a network has the address 172.16.45.14/30, what is the subnetwork this host belongs to?
    - **172.16.45.12** 
        > A /30, regardless of the class of address, has a 252 in the fourth octet. This means we have a block size of 4, and our subnets are 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and so on. Address 14 is obviously in the 12 subnet.
20. On which of the following devices are you typically able to implement NAT?
    - **Router** 
        > Devices with layer 3 awareness, such as routers and firewalls, are the only ones that can manipulate the IP header in support of NAT. A hub operates at the physical layer and cannot perform NAT. Ethernet switches and bridges operate at the Data Link layer and cannot perform NAT.
