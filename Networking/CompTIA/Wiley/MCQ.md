# CompTIA Network+ exam questions

## Chapter 1: Introduction to networks

1. Which network type is locally owned and managed by an organization and used to connect the organization’s LAN together?
    - **CAN**<br>A campus area network (CAN) is a connectivity method that is locally owned and managed by an organization to connect multiple LANs together. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a connectivity method used in a metropolitan area, but it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A wide area network (WAN) is a connectivity method that is used for connectivity in a wide area, and it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices within an extremely close vicinity.
2. Which network topology design has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices?
   - **Star topology**<br>A star topology, also known as hub‐and‐spoke topology, has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices outward like a star. A full mesh topology allows for a decentralized switching design, where any link failure will not affect switching. A partial mesh topology is normally performed between the layers of core, distribution, and access to allow for a single link failure while maintaining switching services. A hybrid topology is where several different topologies are employed, such as star and mesh.
3. Which protocol can be typically found inside a PAN?
   - **Bluetooth**<br>Bluetooth is a common networking protocol found inside a personal area network (PAN) connecting personal devices. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is a technology that uses labels to switch packets. A software‐defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services. A virtual NIC (vNIC) is used to connect a virtual machine (VM) to a virtual switch (vSwitch).
4. When computers are logically grouped on a LAN based upon a functional department in the organization, what is the group called?
   - **Workgroup**<br>A workgroup is a logical grouping of computers on a local area network (LAN) based upon a department’s function. A backbone is the connectivity method that connects multiple network segments together. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects multiple buildings together in close proximity. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices together in close proximity often using Bluetooth technology.
5. Which is the primary benefit to using a star topology?
   - **Easy to troubleshoot**<br>A benefit to the star topology is that it is easy to troubleshoot since each host has its own connection. Equal access is typically a benefit of ring topologies. Bus topologies are typically the simplest network in terms of design, whereas star networks can have redundancy, loops, and many other complex design considerations. Redundancy is not found in star topologies; it is typically in mesh networks.
6. What type of logical connection does MPLS create to connect networks together?
   - **Circuit**<br>A circuit is the logical connection that MPLS creates to connect networks together. A peer‐to‐peer connection is a bidirectional logical connection for sharing files and accessing files. A client‐server connection is another logical connection created for accessing information in one direction from client to server.

8. Which type of traffic flow is routed from your internal network to the Internet?
   - **North-South**<br>North‐south traffic flow describes the flow of information from an internal network to the Internet or other routed destination. East‐west traffic is kept within the internal network or data center and not routed. Wide area network (WAN) and metropolitan area (MAN) network describe a general network type, not traffic flow or a specific connection.
9. Which topology incorporates some redundancy of equipment and connections to provide fault tolerance but is not completely fault‐tolerant?
   - **Hybrid**<br>A mesh topology incorporates redundancy in the form of switches and redundant connections to provide complete fault tolerance to the network design. When a mesh topology is combined with the star (hub‐and‐spoke) topology, it creates a hybrid topology that allows for fault‐tolerant design at a lower cost than a full mesh topology. Ring and bus topology are susceptible to total network failure if there is a failure anywhere in the network.
10. Which topology should be selected if you have a central office that needs to communicate with several branch offices for WAN connectivity?
    - **Point‐to‐multipoint**<br>A point‐to‐multipoint topology should be selected if a central office needs to connect with several branch offices. Popular point‐to‐multipoint connection technologies are frame relay and MPLS, to name a few. A point‐to‐point connection is typically used to connect two offices together. Mesh and bus topologies are not used for WAN connectivity.
11. Which network architecture allows for access or sharing of resources in a network by the same host?
    - **Peer‐to‐peer**<br>Peer‐to‐peer is a network architecture that allows the same host to both access and share resources in a network. Client‐server network architecture strictly defines the client that will access the information and the server that shares the information. Local area network (LAN) is a network type and not related to sharing information. Hybrid topology describes a topology that incorporates two or more topologies.
12. Which is the major advantage of client‐server network architecture?
    - **Centralized management**<br>The major advantage to a client‐server network architecture is the ability to have centralized management. Distributed security is not applicable to client‐server network architecture and is found in a peer‐to‐peer network architecture. The client‐server relationship is rigid and not very flexible. Equal access is an attribute of peer‐to‐peer network architecture.
13. You are setting up a network connection that requires redundancy in the event a switch or single link fails. Which topology should you select?
    - **Mesh**<br>A mesh topology is used for redundancy and protects a network in the event of a switch or link failure. Bus and ring topologies are very susceptible to failure and require a fully functioning network. A star topology by itself does not offer redundancy in the event of failure.
14. Where is the full mesh topology commonly seen in the three‐tier design model?
    - **Distribution layer**<br>Distribution layer switches are fully meshed for redundancy. The core layer is normally implemented with a star topology. The access layer is normally implemented with a partial mesh topology or hybrid topology. Routing layer is not a valid term in the three‐tier design model.

Half‐duplex mode requires a contention method since the same pair is used for transmitting and receiving bits. Full‐duplex mode does not require a contention method for collisions since there is a dedicated pair of wires for transmitting and a dedicated pair of wire for receiving bits.
2. Which field in an Ethernet frame is used to check the integrity of the frame?
    - **FCS**<br>The frame checking sequence (FCS) is a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) calculation used to check the integrity of the frame. The start of frame (SOF) delimiter is a one‐byte field of alternating 1s and 0s that signifies the start of the frame. The preamble allows the other physical connection to synchronize its clocks for the data that follows. The destination address (DA) is the destination MAC address the frame is destined for.
3. What is the significance of the preamble?
    - **The preamble allows the switch to sync timing for the receipt of information to follow.**<br>The preamble allows for the source computer to sync its timing of the physical media–independent interface with the destination computer. It achieves this via an alternating 1 and 0 pattern at a specific frequency depending on data transfer speed. The SFD has an extra bit to let the destination computer know anything that follows is data.
4. In a layer 2 frame, where is the destination MAC address?

    - **The MAC address is locally governed**<br>When the L/G bit (sometimes referred to as the U/L bit) is set, it means the MAC address is locally governed. This means the user has manually set the MAC address. All other answers are incorrect.
8. Which is a reason that the Ethernet protocol uses physical addresses?
    - **It uniquely identifies devices at layer 2**<br>MAC addresses are physical addresses that are burnt into every NIC card and network device. It is unique at the data link layer from direct communication purposes. All other answers are incorrect.
9. What is the 2‐byte type field used for in an Ethernet frame?
    - **It identifies the upper‐layer protocol for the data contained within the frame.**<br>The Ethernet type field is 2 bytes, and it identifies at layer 2 which upper‐layer protocol to send the data to. When IPv4 is used, the type field is 0x0800. When IPv6 is used, the type field is 0x86dd. All other answers are incorrect.
10. What is the purpose of the State of Frame delimiter byte in a frame?
    - **It provides a means for the receiving node to know when data begins.**<br>The preamble is 7 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s at a frequency that matches the bandwidth of the link. It is important to note that the 1s and 0s pattern starts with a 1 and ends with a 0 for 7 bytes (10101010). The SFD has an extra lower bit signaling the end of timing and the start of data (10101011). All other answers are incorrect.
11. How many bits are in a nibble?
    - **4**<br>There are 4 bits in a nibble. A single bit is the lowest value in the binary system, with a potential value of 0 or 1. There are 8 bits in a byte or octet, depending on the base value. 16 bits is a double byte, also called a word.
12. How many bits are in a MAC address?
