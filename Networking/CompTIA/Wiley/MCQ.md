# CompTIA Network+ exam questions

## Chapter 1: Introduction to networks

1. Which network type is locally owned and managed by an organization and used to connect the organization’s LAN together?
    - **CAN**<br>A campus area network (CAN) is a connectivity method that is locally owned and managed by an organization to connect multiple LANs together. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a connectivity method used in a metropolitan area, but it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A wide area network (WAN) is a connectivity method that is used for connectivity in a wide area, and it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices within an extremely close vicinity.
2. Which network topology design has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices?
   - **Star topology**<br>A star topology, also known as hub‐and‐spoke topology, has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices outward like a star. A full mesh topology allows for a decentralized switching design, where any link failure will not affect switching. A partial mesh topology is normally performed between the layers of core, distribution, and access to allow for a single link failure while maintaining switching services. A hybrid topology is where several different topologies are employed, such as star and mesh.
3. Which protocol can be typically found inside a PAN?
   - **Bluetooth**<br>Bluetooth is a common networking protocol found inside a personal area network (PAN) connecting personal devices. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is a technology that uses labels to switch packets. A software‐defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services. A virtual NIC (vNIC) is used to connect a virtual machine (VM) to a virtual switch (vSwitch).
4. When computers are logically grouped on a LAN based upon a functional department in the organization, what is the group called?
   - **Workgroup**<br>A workgroup is a logical grouping of computers on a local area network (LAN) based upon a department’s function. A backbone is the connectivity method that connects multiple network segments together. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects multiple buildings together in close proximity. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices together in close proximity often using Bluetooth technology.
5. Which is the primary benefit to using a star topology?
   - **Easy to troubleshoot**<br>A benefit to the star topology is that it is easy to troubleshoot since each host has its own connection. Equal access is typically a benefit of ring topologies. Bus topologies are typically the simplest network in terms of design, whereas star networks can have redundancy, loops, and many other complex design considerations. Redundancy is not found in star topologies; it is typically in mesh networks.
6. What type of logical connection does MPLS create to connect networks together?
   - **Circuit**<br>A circuit is the logical connection that MPLS creates to connect networks together. A peer‐to‐peer connection is a bidirectional logical connection for sharing files and accessing files. A client‐server connection is another logical connection created for accessing information in one direction from client to server.

8. Which type of traffic flow is routed from your internal network to the Internet?
   - **North-South**<br>North‐south traffic flow describes the flow of information from an internal network to the Internet or other routed destination. East‐west traffic is kept within the internal network or data center and not routed. Wide area network (WAN) and metropolitan area (MAN) network describe a general network type, not traffic flow or a specific connection.
9. Which topology incorporates some redundancy of equipment and connections to provide fault tolerance but is not completely fault‐tolerant?
   - **Hybrid**<br>A mesh topology incorporates redundancy in the form of switches and redundant connections to provide complete fault tolerance to the network design. When a mesh topology is combined with the star (hub‐and‐spoke) topology, it creates a hybrid topology that allows for fault‐tolerant design at a lower cost than a full mesh topology. Ring and bus topology are susceptible to total network failure if there is a failure anywhere in the network.
10. Which topology should be selected if you have a central office that needs to communicate with several branch offices for WAN connectivity?
    - **Point‐to‐multipoint**<br>A point‐to‐multipoint topology should be selected if a central office needs to connect with several branch offices. Popular point‐to‐multipoint connection technologies are frame relay and MPLS, to name a few. A point‐to‐point connection is typically used to connect two offices together. Mesh and bus topologies are not used for WAN connectivity.
11. Which network architecture allows for access or sharing of resources in a network by the same host?
    - **Peer‐to‐peer**<br>Peer‐to‐peer is a network architecture that allows the same host to both access and share resources in a network. Client‐server network architecture strictly defines the client that will access the information and the server that shares the information. Local area network (LAN) is a network type and not related to sharing information. Hybrid topology describes a topology that incorporates two or more topologies.
12. Which is the major advantage of client‐server network architecture?
    - **Centralized management**<br>The major advantage to a client‐server network architecture is the ability to have centralized management. Distributed security is not applicable to client‐server network architecture and is found in a peer‐to‐peer network architecture. The client‐server relationship is rigid and not very flexible. Equal access is an attribute of peer‐to‐peer network architecture.
13. You are setting up a network connection that requires redundancy in the event a switch or single link fails. Which topology should you select?
    - **Mesh**<br>A mesh topology is used for redundancy and protects a network in the event of a switch or link failure. Bus and ring topologies are very susceptible to failure and require a fully functioning network. A star topology by itself does not offer redundancy in the event of failure.
14. Where is the full mesh topology commonly seen in the three‐tier design model?
    - **Distribution layer**<br>Distribution layer switches are fully meshed for redundancy. The core layer is normally implemented with a star topology. The access layer is normally implemented with a partial mesh topology or hybrid topology. Routing layer is not a valid term in the three‐tier design model.

Half‐duplex mode requires a contention method since the same pair is used for transmitting and receiving bits. Full‐duplex mode does not require a contention method for collisions since there is a dedicated pair of wires for transmitting and a dedicated pair of wire for receiving bits.
2. Which field in an Ethernet frame is used to check the integrity of the frame?
    - **FCS**<br>The frame checking sequence (FCS) is a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) calculation used to check the integrity of the frame. The start of frame (SOF) delimiter is a one‐byte field of alternating 1s and 0s that signifies the start of the frame. The preamble allows the other physical connection to synchronize its clocks for the data that follows. The destination address (DA) is the destination MAC address the frame is destined for.
3. What is the significance of the preamble?
    - **The preamble allows the switch to sync timing for the receipt of information to follow.**<br>The preamble allows for the source computer to sync its timing of the physical media–independent interface with the destination computer. It achieves this via an alternating 1 and 0 pattern at a specific frequency depending on data transfer speed. The SFD has an extra bit to let the destination computer know anything that follows is data.
4. In a layer 2 frame, where is the destination MAC address?

    - **The MAC address is locally governed**<br>When the L/G bit (sometimes referred to as the U/L bit) is set, it means the MAC address is locally governed. This means the user has manually set the MAC address. All other answers are incorrect.
8. Which is a reason that the Ethernet protocol uses physical addresses?
    - **It uniquely identifies devices at layer 2**<br>MAC addresses are physical addresses that are burnt into every NIC card and network device. It is unique at the data link layer from direct communication purposes. All other answers are incorrect.
9. What is the 2‐byte type field used for in an Ethernet frame?
    - **It identifies the upper‐layer protocol for the data contained within the frame.**<br>The Ethernet type field is 2 bytes, and it identifies at layer 2 which upper‐layer protocol to send the data to. When IPv4 is used, the type field is 0x0800. When IPv6 is used, the type field is 0x86dd. All other answers are incorrect.
10. What is the purpose of the State of Frame delimiter byte in a frame?
    - **It provides a means for the receiving node to know when data begins.**<br>The preamble is 7 bytes of alternating 1s and 0s at a frequency that matches the bandwidth of the link. It is important to note that the 1s and 0s pattern starts with a 1 and ends with a 0 for 7 bytes (10101010). The SFD has an extra lower bit signaling the end of timing and the start of data (10101011). All other answers are incorrect.
11. How many bits are in a nibble?
    - **4**<br>There are 4 bits in a nibble. A single bit is the lowest value in the binary system, with a potential value of 0 or 1. There are 8 bits in a byte or octet, depending on the base value. 16 bits is a double byte, also called a word.
12. How many bits are in a MAC address?

Multimedia over Coax (MoCA) is a technology that provides network connectivity over coaxial lines. HDMI Ethernet Channel technology consolidates video, audio, and data streams into a single HDMI cable. HomePlug is a technology that allows you to run local area network (LAN) traffic in your home, over your home’s power line.
15. Which statement is true when a collision is detected on the network?
    - **A jam signal is sent to all hosts on the segment.**<br>When a collision occurs, a jam signal is sent to all hosts on the segment to notify them of the collision. A random backoff algorithm will take effect, after which all hosts will have equal priority to transmit again. All other answers are incorrect.
16. How many bits are used to represent the hexadecimal value of 0x0020?
    - **16**<br>The hexadecimal value of 0x0020 contains 16 bits. Each digit is a hexadecimal value, and there are 4 digits that trail the 0x hex identifier. Each digit has 4 bits and 4 digits × 4 bits = 16 bits. All other answers are incorrect.
17. Which 3 bytes of the Media Access Control (MAC) address F3‐B2‐CD‐E4‐F4‐42 designate the unique station identifier?
    - **E4‐F4‐42**<br>The last 3 bytes, E4‐F4‐42, of the Media Access Control (MAC) address designate the unique station identifier. The first 3 bytes, F3‐B2‐CD, are the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). All other answers are incorrect.
18. Which protocol does a host use to find the hardware address of a neighbor host by using the destination IP address?
    - **ARP**<br>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to find the MAC address of another host on the same LAN. On an Ethernet network, the MAC address (hardware address) is used for one host to communicate with another. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are both Transport layer protocols used to transmit segments. The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is used for name resolution.
19. What are the speed, maximum distance, and media of 10GBaseT?
    - **10 Gb/s, 100 meters, and copper**<br>The Ethernet specification of 10GBaseT is 10 Gb/s with a maximum distance of 100 meters over copper. All other answers are incorrect.
20. How many wire pairs are used with 1000BaseTX?
    - **Four**<br>1000BaseTX uses two pairs of wires, one pair for transmitting and one pair for receiving. All other answers are incorrect.

## Chapter 5: Networking Devices
1. You have been asked to change the IP address in external DNS for a mail server in your organization. Which record can be changed with the least amount of effort?
   - **A record**<br>The alias, or A, record that matches the MX record configured for the mail server should be changed. If you were to change the MX record, a new alias record would need to be created as well, since every MX record contains the FQDN that maps to an alias record. A PTR record is used for reverse DNS and will not solve the problem. A TXT record is used to resolve plaintext and does not solve the problem.
2. Which is a valid reason to implement a wireless LAN controller?
   - **Centralized provisioning**<br>Centralized provisioning of lightweight wireless access points (LWAPs) is a valid reason to implement a WLAN controller. Although a wireless LAN controller makes it easier to implement multiple SSIDs and VLANs, this task can be performed with autonomous WAPs, each performing its own authentication. The use of autonomous WAPs negates the reasons you would use a WLAN controller because each WAP would be independently managed and no coordination would exist between the autonomous WAPs. The use of multiple SSIDs can be achieved with an autonomous WAP without a WLAN controller. Multiple VLANs can also be used with an autonomous WAP without a WLAN controller.
3. What is the benefit of network segmentation?
   - **Increased broadcast domains**<br>Network segmentation increases the number of broadcast domains. This effectively decreases the number of broadcasts seen on a network segment and effectively increases bandwidth. All other answers are incorrect.
4. Which protocol and port do you need to configure on the inbound host‐based firewall for a DHCP server?
   - **UDP/67**<br>The DHCP server waits for connection from clients on UDP/67; the clients will send the requests from UDP/68. Therefore, the inbound host‐based firewall should be configured to accept traffic from UDP/67.
5. Which type of device will detect but not prevent unauthorized access?
   - **IDS**<br>An IDS, or intrusion detection system, will detect unauthorized access. However, it will not prevent unauthorized access. It is a form of audit control in a network. A firewall will protect your network from attack by placing rules defining how people can connect as well as which traffic can pass. An intrusion protection system (IPS) will detect the presence of an intrusion and alert an administrator. A honeypot will attract a malicious user so that their tactics can be observed. It performs this function by diverting the malicious user from production systems to the honeypot, which is a sacrificial system.
6. Your organization expects a considerable amount of traffic to your web server, so you plan to install several web servers. How can you maintain one FQDN and allow customers to be directed to the next free web servers?
   - **Load balancer**<br>A load balancer will direct a user’s request to the next free web server. A router will only route traffic to a destination network. A firewall would not accomplish the requirement of distribution of the load. A proxy is something that might fetch the web page on the web server, but it will not provide load balancing.
7. Your organization has deployed several autonomous WAPs. Users complain that they consistently drop the wireless connection when roaming. What should you recommend to resolve this issue?
   - **Wireless LAN controller**<br>Autonomous WAPs do not have any coordination between them for roaming clients. When a client roams from one WAP to another, they must reauthenticate, and this causes a drop. Implementing a wireless LAN controller will coordinate roaming clients and not require reauthentication.
8. You need to make sure that a printer is configured with the same IP address every time it is turned on. However, the printer is too troublesome to configure a static IP address. What can be done to achieve the goal?
   - **Configure a DHCP reservation for the printer.**<br>A DHCP reservation will allow for the printer to obtain the same IP address every time it is turned on. The DHCP server will serve the same IP address to the printer based on the printer’s MAC address in the reservation. Configuring an A record will not achieve the goal. Configuring a DHCP exclusion for the printer would work only if you had already set it to a static IP address and didn’t want that IP address assigned to another host. Configuring an PTR record will not achieve the goal.
9.  Which record type is used for an IPv4 address mapping to FQDN for DNS queries?
   - **The PTR record**<br>The PTR, or pointer record, is used to look up IP addresses and return FQDNs that are mapped to them. This is helpful to identify an IP address, and in the case of SSH, it is used to positively identify the host you are connecting to. The A record is used to look up an IP address for a given hostname. The CName record is used to look up the alias for a given hostname. The AAAA record is used to look up an IPv6 address for a given hostname.
10. Which device will act as a multiport repeater in the network?
   - **Hub**<br>A hub will act as a multiport repeater by repeating the physical bits on an incoming port to all the other connected ports. A switch or bridge will forward the frame only to the port it is destined for. Even when broadcasts are received, the frame is still processed and not blindly repeated. A WAP acts similarly to a switch and will forward frames only to the connected wireless or wired network.
11. Which is a correct statement when hubs are replaced with switches?
   - **The replacement increases collision domains.**<br>The replacement of hubs with switches increases collision domains and effectively increases bandwidth. The replacement of switches with hubs can decrease the number of collision domains, creating a much larger collision domain. The replacement of hubs with switches has no effect on broadcast domains. Broadcast domains would be affected only if a router was introduced.
12. When firewalls are placed in a network, which zone contains Internet‐facing services?
   - **Demilitarized zone**<br>The demilitarized zone (DMZ) or screen subnet is where Internet‐facing servers/services are placed. The outside zone is where the public Internet connection is connected, and it is the least trusted. The enterprise network zone is considered the inside zone. The inside zone is considered to be the highest trusted network because it is the internal network that you control.
13. Which is a false statement about firewalls?
   - **Firewalls are commonly deployed to protect a network from internal attacks.**<br>Firewalls are not commonly deployed to provide protection from internal attacks on internal resources. They are designed to protect networks from external attacks or attacks emanating from the outside or directed toward the Internet. Firewalls normally provide stateful packet inspection. Firewalls can also control application traffic by port number and higher‐layer attributes.
14. Which statement is correct about reverse lookups?
   - **A reverse lookup is the resolution of an IP address to FQDN.**<br>A reverse lookup is when the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is resolved from an IP address. This is useful when you want to identify an IP address. From the IP address, you can derive the FQDN. A reverse lookup is not when the request needs to be reversed to another DNS server. A reverse lookup is not when the DNS queried can answer the request without asking another DNS server. A reverse lookup is not the resolution of an FQDN to an IP address; it is the resolution of an IP address to an FQDN.
15. What gets appended to hostname queries for DNS resolution?
   - **The DNS suffix**<br>The configured DNS suffix is appended to the hostname query. As an example, if you query a hostname of hosta and the configured domain name is network.local, the DNS server will see a query for hosta.network.local. The DNS zone is the database of records contained in DNS. Host header is a term used with web servers and therefore not relevant to DNS resolution. The hostname PTR record is the reverse DNS record for a given IP address.
16. Which type of DNS record holds the IPv4 IP address for a hostname?
   - **The A record**<br>The A record is the DNS record that is queried when you want to resolve a hostname to an IP address. The CName record is used to look up the alias for a given hostname. The PTR, or pointer record, is used to look up IP addresses and return FQDNs that are mapped to them. The AAAA record is used to look up an IPv6 address for a given hostname.
17. Which of the following devices can work at both layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model?
   - **Multilayer switch**<br>A multilayer switch can provide both routing and switching capabilities since it operates on layers 2 and 3. A hub is a device that operates only on layer 1. A switch or bridge is a layer 2 device that segments the network.
18. What is an advantage of using DHCP in a network environment?
   - **Automatically assigns IP addresses to hosts**<br>An advantage to DHCP in a network environment is that it automatically assigns IP addresses to hosts. There is minimal difficulty to administrate DHCP, and this is not considered a benefit. Static IP addressing is used in lieu of a DHCP. DHCP does not send an operating system to a PC, but it can direct it to do so with DHCP options.
19. What is a benefit to installing a proxy server?
   - **Web caching**<br>Web caching is a tremendous benefit to employing a proxy server. Commonly accessed web pages will be cached, and subsequent requests will be returned locally from the proxy server. The throughput for the network will not increase. DHCP services will not be provided with a proxy server, only the proxying of web pages. Support for user authentication is not a benefit of employing a proxy server.
20. Which protocol and port number does DNS use for direct queries?
   - **UDP/53**<br>Domain Name System (DNS) direct queries are performed over the UDP protocol to port 53. The queries do not require the TCP setup and teardown because the queries are simple request and reply messages, so UDP is used for direct queries. TCP port 53 is used for DNS zone transfers between DNS servers. UDP port 55 is not used for any popular protocols. UDP port 68 is used with the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
