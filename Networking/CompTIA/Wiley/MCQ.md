# CompTIA Network+ exam questions

## Chapter 1: Introduction to networks

1. Which network type is locally owned and managed by an organization and used to connect the organization’s LAN together?
    - **CAN**<br>A campus area network (CAN) is a connectivity method that is locally owned and managed by an organization to connect multiple LANs together. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a connectivity method used in a metropolitan area, but it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A wide area network (WAN) is a connectivity method that is used for connectivity in a wide area, and it is owned and managed by someone other than the organization. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices within an extremely close vicinity.
2. Which network topology design has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices?
   - **Star topology**<br>A star topology, also known as hub‐and‐spoke topology, has a centralized switch connecting all of the devices outward like a star. A full mesh topology allows for a decentralized switching design, where any link failure will not affect switching. A partial mesh topology is normally performed between the layers of core, distribution, and access to allow for a single link failure while maintaining switching services. A hybrid topology is where several different topologies are employed, such as star and mesh.
3. Which protocol can be typically found inside a PAN?
   - **Bluetooth**<br>Bluetooth is a common networking protocol found inside a personal area network (PAN) connecting personal devices. Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is a technology that uses labels to switch packets. A software‐defined wide area network (SDWAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that uses software to manage connectivity, devices, and services. A virtual NIC (vNIC) is used to connect a virtual machine (VM) to a virtual switch (vSwitch).
4. When computers are logically grouped on a LAN based upon a functional department in the organization, what is the group called?
   - **Workgroup**<br>A workgroup is a logical grouping of computers on a local area network (LAN) based upon a department’s function. A backbone is the connectivity method that connects multiple network segments together. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects multiple buildings together in close proximity. A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects personal devices together in close proximity often using Bluetooth technology.
5. Which is the primary benefit to using a star topology?
   - **Easy to troubleshoot**<br>A benefit to the star topology is that it is easy to troubleshoot since each host has its own connection. Equal access is typically a benefit of ring topologies. Bus topologies are typically the simplest network in terms of design, whereas star networks can have redundancy, loops, and many other complex design considerations. Redundancy is not found in star topologies; it is typically in mesh networks.
6. What type of logical connection does MPLS create to connect networks together?
   - **Circuit**<br>A circuit is the logical connection that MPLS creates to connect networks together. A peer‐to‐peer connection is a bidirectional logical connection for sharing files and accessing files. A client‐server connection is another logical connection created for accessing information in one direction from client to server. East‐west is a term used to describe traffic within the same network or data center.
7. Which type of network is used exclusively for storage traffic?
   - **SAN**<br>A storage area network (SAN) is a network that is used exclusively for storage traffic. A campus area network (CAN) is a network that connects buildings together in close proximity. A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that connects clients within a metropolitan area, such as a city, together. A local area network (LAN) is a network within a building or residence that connects hosts together.
8. Which type of traffic flow is routed from your internal network to the Internet?
   - **North-South**<br>North‐south traffic flow describes the flow of information from an internal network to the Internet or other routed destination. East‐west traffic is kept within the internal network or data center and not routed. Wide area network (WAN) and metropolitan area (MAN) network describe a general network type, not traffic flow or a specific connection.
9. Which topology incorporates some redundancy of equipment and connections to provide fault tolerance but is not completely fault‐tolerant?
   - **Hybrid**<br>A mesh topology incorporates redundancy in the form of switches and redundant connections to provide complete fault tolerance to the network design. When a mesh topology is combined with the star (hub‐and‐spoke) topology, it creates a hybrid topology that allows for fault‐tolerant design at a lower cost than a full mesh topology. Ring and bus topology are susceptible to total network failure if there is a failure anywhere in the network.
10. Which topology should be selected if you have a central office that needs to communicate with several branch offices for WAN connectivity?
    - **Point‐to‐multipoint**<br>A point‐to‐multipoint topology should be selected if a central office needs to connect with several branch offices. Popular point‐to‐multipoint connection technologies are frame relay and MPLS, to name a few. A point‐to‐point connection is typically used to connect two offices together. Mesh and bus topologies are not used for WAN connectivity.
11. Which network architecture allows for access or sharing of resources in a network by the same host?
    - **Peer‐to‐peer**<br>Peer‐to‐peer is a network architecture that allows the same host to both access and share resources in a network. Client‐server network architecture strictly defines the client that will access the information and the server that shares the information. Local area network (LAN) is a network type and not related to sharing information. Hybrid topology describes a topology that incorporates two or more topologies.
12. Which is the major advantage of client‐server network architecture?
    - **Centralized management**<br>The major advantage to a client‐server network architecture is the ability to have centralized management. Distributed security is not applicable to client‐server network architecture and is found in a peer‐to‐peer network architecture. The client‐server relationship is rigid and not very flexible. Equal access is an attribute of peer‐to‐peer network architecture.
13. You are setting up a network connection that requires redundancy in the event a switch or single link fails. Which topology should you select?
    - **Mesh**<br>A mesh topology is used for redundancy and protects a network in the event of a switch or link failure. Bus and ring topologies are very susceptible to failure and require a fully functioning network. A star topology by itself does not offer redundancy in the event of failure.
14. Where is the full mesh topology commonly seen in the three‐tier design model?
    - **Distribution layer**<br>Distribution layer switches are fully meshed for redundancy. The core layer is normally implemented with a star topology. The access layer is normally implemented with a partial mesh topology or hybrid topology. Routing layer is not a valid term in the three‐tier design model.
15. Which connectivity method is used within a small geographic area to connect an organization together?
