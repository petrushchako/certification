    > This would not be part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). An NDA is a confidentiality agreement. It is a legally binding contract between two or more entities, such as between a company and an employee, designed to protect proprietary information and trade secrets. It does not address data or activity outside of the scope of the contract principals.
    > This would not be part of a service level agreement (SLA). An SLA defines levels of service provided by a customer to its customers. For example, an SLA could define items such as performance metrics and guaranteed availability.
    > This would not be part of a bring your own device (BYOD) policy. If personal devices are authorized through a BYOD policy, their acceptable use would be outlined in the AUP. The specific content of a BYOD varies by organization depending on its needs, security concerns, and network support for devices. Where possible, policies are typically enforced through network configurations and settings.
