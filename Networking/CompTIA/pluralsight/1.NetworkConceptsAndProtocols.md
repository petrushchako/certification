## Networking Concepts
### What Is Data Networking?

When many people think of data networking, they imagine common **home networking devices** such as:
- Cable, DSL, or fiber modems
- Wireless routers providing connectivity to smartphones, tablets, and laptops

However, data networking extends beyond the home environment. In business or data center environments, it involves structured or sometimes messy **network switches** and cabling systems used to interconnect large numbers of devices.

The **key concept** is not just the physical devices but **how information moves** between endpoints.

**Example**:
- A user on a PC requests an article from the Wikimedia Foundation server.
- The request travels through a data network (the “cloud” representing switches, routers, fiber optics, and wireless links).
- The server responds, and data is transferred back to the user.

**Definition:**

> Data networking is a system of hardware, software, and protocols used to move information from one device to another.


### Communication Processes

To understand networking, consider a simple **cell phone call**:
1. **Initiation:**
   Leia uses her smartphone to call Obi. She opens her contacts, taps on Obi’s number, and initiates the call.
2. **Signal Conversion – Leia’s Side:**
   - Her **voice vibrates the microphone membrane**, producing an electrical signal.
   - The phone converts the electrical signal into a **wireless signal**.
   - That signal travels to the nearest **cell tower**.
3. **Transmission Through the Network:**
   - The cell tower converts the wireless signal to a signal suitable for **wired or fiber optic networks**.
   - It travels through the telephone network to the cell tower nearest to Obi.
4. **Signal Conversion – Obi’s Side:**
   - The signal is converted back into a **wireless signal** sent to Obi’s phone.
   - The phone converts the signal into **speaker vibrations**, producing sound Obi can hear.

Throughout this entire process, the **original message** (Leia’s voice) is **encapsulated and transmitted through multiple media types**—wireless, wired, fiber, etc.—without losing its meaning.

This is analogous to how data networks work:
- Messages are **encapsulated into packets** (virtual envelopes).
- Packets are transmitted across multiple **network layers and media types**.
- The message is **decoded at the destination**.

#### CompTIA Network+ Exam Information

## Using the OSI Model to Describe Network Operations
### Introduction
In this module, Ross Bagurdes introduces the **OSI model**, a fundamental framework used to describe how different components of a network interact in a structured and layered manner.

Goals of the module:
- Introduce the OSI model.
- Revisit the phone call analogy between Leia and Obi.
- Model network operations using the OSI framework.
### What Is the OSI Model?
- **OSI** stands for **Open Systems Interconnect**.
- Developed in the 1970s to **standardize** how data communications are described and categorized.
- Provides a **structured way** to understand how protocols interact in a **specific order of operations**.

Just like a telephone call follows an exact sequence (air vibrations → microphone → electrical → wireless → back to audio), network communication also follows **a strict set of rules and layers**.

### Home Network Example
1. **PC / Workstation (Client)** – End-user device to access the internet.
2. **Wireless Router** – Provides local connectivity via wired or wireless connections.
3. **Modem** – Bridges the local network to the ISP and the wider internet.
4. **Internet Cloud** – Represents the vast number of interconnected devices and protocols.
5. **Server** – Destination of user requests (e.g., Pluralsight).

Example:
A user enters `pluralsight.com` in their browser.
- The workstation sends a request to the server.
- The server responds with the website content.
- Data travels across multiple devices, cables, and protocols in a **layered** manner.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- **Description:** Physical medium of transmission (wired or wireless).
- **Components:**
  - Twisted pair cables (Ethernet)
  - Coaxial cables (ISP connection)
  - Fiber optic cables (internet backbone)
  - Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, point-to-point links)
- **Function:** Defines physical specifications, connectors, and media types.

This layer does **not** process data logically — it only defines **how signals are transmitted**.
### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- **Description:** Defines protocols that **move data across the physical media**.
- **Common Protocols:**
  - **Ethernet** (PC ↔ Router, Router ↔ Modem, Server ↔ Switches)
  - **DOCSIS** (Modem ↔ ISP)
- **Function:**
  - Provides structure to use physical media.
  - Defines how frames are created, transmitted, and processed.
  - Enables communication **within a local segment**.
### Layer 3: Network Layer
- **Description:** Enables communication **between networks**, not just local devices.
- **Key Protocol:** **Internet Protocol (IP)**.
- **Function:**
  - Logical addressing (IP addresses).
  - Routing between devices across different networks.
  - Establishes the path for packets from the source to the destination (e.g., Workstation → Pluralsight server).
### Layer 4: Transport Layer
- **Description:** Manages sessions between two devices for reliable communication.
- **Key Protocol:** **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**.
- **Analogy:**
  - Dialing a number
  - Waiting for the phone to ring
  - Saying hello on both ends
  - Beginning the conversation
- **Function:**
  - Sets up a session using TCP’s **three-way handshake**.
  - Ensures data is delivered in order and without errors.
  - Uses IP to find devices and Data Link + Physical layers to transfer the packets.
### Layer 7: Application Layer
- **Description:** Interfaces directly with the end user or application.
- **Key Protocols:**
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**
- **Function:**
  - Web browsers use HTTP/HTTPS to request HTML documents.
  - Servers respond with content (e.g., web pages, files, data).
  - Operates independently from lower-layer transmission mechanisms.

### Layers 5 and 6: Session and Presentation
- **Layer 6 (Presentation):**
  - Historically used for **data format translation** between different encoding standards.
  - **ASCII** vs **EBCDIC** translation (e.g., “Don’t Panic” encoded differently).
  - Rarely used today—most functions are handled by applications.
- **Layer 5 (Session):**
  - Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
  - Some protocols operate here, but **in modern networks**, most session handling is part of the **Application Layer**.


### OSI Model Summary Table

| OSI Layer    | Layer Number | Examples                      | Function                                     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

## Encapsulation and the OSI Model
#### Overview of the OSI Model
The **OSI model** defines how data is transmitted between systems through different layers, each with a specific function. For simplicity, this explanation focuses on five layers:

- **Application Layer (Layer 7)** – Deals with application protocols like **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** for web traffic.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** – Sets up sessions between endpoints, adds port information, and ensures data integrity.
- **Network Layer (Layer 3)** – Determines the path through the network using IP addresses.
- **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** – Handles node-to-node delivery (e.g., between devices and switches).
- **Physical Layer (Layer 1)** – Transmits raw bits as electrical, light, or wireless signals.

#### Concept of Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with protocol information at each layer of the OSI model. Each layer adds its own header to the data, creating a structured unit that can be transmitted across the network.

1. **Application Layer:**
   - Generates the original data (e.g., an HTTP request to Pluralsight).
   - Data is written in **Hypertext Markup Language** and transferred using HTTP.
2. **Transport Layer:**
   - Breaks the data into smaller chunks.
   - Adds a **TCP header** with:
     - Source and destination port numbers
     - Flags for session control
     - Sequence and acknowledgment numbers
   - This combination of TCP header + data is called a **segment**.
   - Analogy: Writing a birthday card, placing it in an envelope with addresses.
3. **Network Layer:**
   - Adds source and destination **IP addresses**.
   - Includes a **TTL (Time to Live)** field to prevent infinite routing loops.
   - Segment becomes the payload of a **packet** at this layer.
   - Example: **Internet Protocol version 4**.
4. **Data Link Layer:**
   - Encapsulates the packet into a **frame** by adding MAC addresses (source and destination).
   - Typically uses **Ethernet frame** for LAN communication.
   - Handles maximum transmission unit (MTU) size (commonly 1500 bytes).
5. **Physical Layer:**
   - Converts the frame into bits (1s and 0s).
   - Transmits it as:
     - Electrical signals (copper cable)
     - Light signals (fiber optics)
     - Electromagnetic waves (wireless)

#### Key Terms and Units of Data
| OSI Layer   | Encapsulated Unit | Header Type           | Example Protocol        |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Application | Data              | None                  | HTTP                    |
| Transport   | Segment           | TCP or UDP header     | TCP                     |
| Network     | Packet            | IP header             | IPv4 / IPv6             |
| Data Link   | Frame             | MAC header (Ethernet) | Ethernet                |
| Physical    | Bits              | N/A                   | Fiber, copper, wireless |


### Encapsulation in Action (Web Example)
When a user visits **pluralsight.com**:

1. **Application Layer**: The browser generates an HTTP request.
2. **Transport Layer**: The request is segmented and labeled with port information.
3. **Network Layer**: The segment is packaged into a packet with source/destination IPs.
4. **Data Link Layer**: The packet is placed in a frame with MAC addresses.
5. **Physical Layer**: The frame is sent as a signal across the network.

Throughout the journey, the **packet remains the same**, but the **frame changes** as it moves from one hop to another (e.g., workstation → switch → router → modem → internet).

#### Summary
- Encapsulation is like nesting envelopes: data is wrapped layer by layer before being sent.
- **Segment** at the Transport layer, **Packet** at the Network layer, and **Frame** at the Data Link layer are critical concepts.
- The **Physical layer** converts everything into bits for transmission.
- This layered encapsulation process is the foundation of how all data travels over networks.

## Using the OSI Model to Describe Network Operations
This module explores how the **OSI model** helps describe and understand network operations.
The OSI model, short for **Open Systems Interconnect**, was developed in the 1970s to standardize how data communication occurs across different systems and technologies. It provides a structured framework for how data moves from one device to another.

The goal of this module is to:
- Introduce the OSI model and its purpose.
- Use the analogy of a telephone call between Leia and Obi to explain the concept.
- Apply the OSI model to describe real network communication between devices such as PCs, routers, modems, and servers.

### The OSI Model Overview
The OSI model defines **seven layers** that represent how data moves from one application to another over a network. Each layer has a specific role and interacts with the layers directly above and below it.

### Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- The **Physical layer** represents the **physical transmission medium** — the actual cables, connectors, or wireless signals that carry data.
- It defines **electrical, mechanical, and signaling standards**, not the data itself.
- Examples include:
  - **Twisted pair cables (Ethernet)** connecting PCs to routers.
  - **Coaxial cables** connecting modems to ISPs.
  - **Fiber optics** used for high-speed internet backbones.
  - **Wireless signals** that use radio frequencies instead of wires.

Everything at this layer follows strict standards but contains **no electronics or logic** — only the physical medium that moves bits (1s and 0s).

### Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- The **Data Link layer** is responsible for **local device-to-device communication** over the physical medium.
- It defines **protocols and rules** for transferring data across a single link (e.g., from a PC to a switch).
- Key protocols include:
  - **Ethernet** – used in LANs (workstation ↔ router, server ↔ switch).
  - **Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification** (DOCSIS 3) – used between cable modems and ISPs.
- This layer also provides **MAC addressing** and defines how frames are formatted and transmitted.

Layer 2 enables local delivery of data but does **not** handle long-distance routing.

### Network Layer (Layer 3)
- The **Network layer** handles **logical addressing and routing** across multiple networks.
- It allows communication **beyond the local link**, enabling data to travel across the internet.
- The key protocol here is **Internet Protocol** (IP).
- Components of Layer 3:
  - **IP addressing** (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) identifies each device globally.
  - **Routing** determines the path a packet takes across networks.
- The network layer builds on Layers 1 and 2 to send messages over long distances between endpoints, such as from a **PC** to **pluralsight.com**.

### Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- The **Transport layer** establishes **end-to-end communication** between client and server applications.
- It ensures **reliable data delivery**, proper sequencing, and error checking.
- The most common protocol is **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP).
- TCP sets up a **session** through a **three-way handshake**:
  1. Client sends a connection request (SYN).
  2. Server acknowledges (SYN-ACK).
  3. Client confirms (ACK).
- Once the session is established, data can flow reliably in both directions.

Analogy: When Leia calls Obi, she must dial his number, wait for the phone to ring, and hear him answer before the conversation starts — the same logic TCP uses to establish a session.

### Application Layer (Layer 7)
- The **Application layer** is where **user-facing network services** operate.
- It defines how applications communicate with each other using high-level protocols.
- Common examples include:
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) and **HTTPS** – used by browsers to access web pages.
  - **Hypertext Markup Language** (HTML) – the format of web pages.
- In this example:
  - The client’s web browser requests `pluralsight.com` using HTTP.
  - The server responds with an HTML document (the website).
  
This interaction depends on lower layers — the session is built at the transport layer, routing occurs at the network layer, and data is transmitted over data link and physical layers.

### Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
- The **Presentation layer** was originally responsible for **data translation, encryption, and compression**.
- In the 1970s, it was used to translate between systems that encoded text differently:
  - **American Standard Code for Information Interchange** (ASCII) – used by open systems and universities.
  - **Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code** (EBCDIC) – used by IBM systems.
- Example: The message “Don’t Panic” would be represented by different hexadecimal values in ASCII and EBCDIC.
- Today, this layer is largely **obsolete**, as modern systems use universal encoding standards (like UTF-8).

### Session Layer (Layer 5)
- The **Session layer** was designed to **manage sessions** between systems — establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication.
- While some protocols technically exist here, most **modern networking protocols merge session responsibilities** into the **Application or Transport layers**, making this layer less relevant today.

<br>

### Summary
- The OSI model provides a **structured framework** that categorizes network functions and protocols into seven layers.
- Each layer depends on the services of the one below it to deliver data effectively.
- The layers are:

  1. **Physical** – Transmission medium (wires, fiber, wireless)
  2. **Data Link** – Local communication (Ethernet, DOCSIS)
  3. **Network** – Routing and IP addressing
  4. **Transport** – Sessions and reliability (TCP)
  5. **Session** – Connection management (rarely used)
  6. **Presentation** – Data translation (largely obsolete)
  7. **Application** – User-level interaction (HTTP, HTML)

The OSI model gives us a **precise order of operations** for network communication and a **framework for categorizing protocols**. Understanding it provides the foundation for diagnosing, designing, and analyzing network operations.
