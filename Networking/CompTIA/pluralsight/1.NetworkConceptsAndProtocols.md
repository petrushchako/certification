## Networking Concepts
### What Is Data Networking?

When many people think of data networking, they imagine common **home networking devices** such as:
- Cable, DSL, or fiber modems
- Wireless routers providing connectivity to smartphones, tablets, and laptops

However, data networking extends beyond the home environment. In business or data center environments, it involves structured or sometimes messy **network switches** and cabling systems used to interconnect large numbers of devices.

The **key concept** is not just the physical devices but **how information moves** between endpoints.

**Example**:
- A user on a PC requests an article from the Wikimedia Foundation server.
- The request travels through a data network (the “cloud” representing switches, routers, fiber optics, and wireless links).
- The server responds, and data is transferred back to the user.

**Definition:**

> Data networking is a system of hardware, software, and protocols used to move information from one device to another.


### Communication Processes

To understand networking, consider a simple **cell phone call**:
1. **Initiation:**
   Leia uses her smartphone to call Obi. She opens her contacts, taps on Obi’s number, and initiates the call.
2. **Signal Conversion – Leia’s Side:**
   - Her **voice vibrates the microphone membrane**, producing an electrical signal.
   - The phone converts the electrical signal into a **wireless signal**.
   - That signal travels to the nearest **cell tower**.
3. **Transmission Through the Network:**
   - The cell tower converts the wireless signal to a signal suitable for **wired or fiber optic networks**.
   - It travels through the telephone network to the cell tower nearest to Obi.
4. **Signal Conversion – Obi’s Side:**
   - The signal is converted back into a **wireless signal** sent to Obi’s phone.
   - The phone converts the signal into **speaker vibrations**, producing sound Obi can hear.

Throughout this entire process, the **original message** (Leia’s voice) is **encapsulated and transmitted through multiple media types**—wireless, wired, fiber, etc.—without losing its meaning.

This is analogous to how data networks work:
- Messages are **encapsulated into packets** (virtual envelopes).
- Packets are transmitted across multiple **network layers and media types**.
- The message is **decoded at the destination**.

#### CompTIA Network+ Exam Information

For those preparing for the CompTIA Network+ N10-008 exam, it is recommended to download the **official exam objectives** from:

```
https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network
```

The exam covers **five major domains**:

| DOMAIN | PERCENTAGE OF EXAMINATION |
|:---|:---|
| 1.0 Networking Fundamentals | 24% |
| 2.0 Network Implementations | 19% |
| 3.0 Network Operations | 16% |
| 4.0 Network Security | 19% |
| 5.0 Network Troubleshooting | 22% |
|**Total** | **100%** |

#### Summary
- **Data networking** is about **transferring information** between devices using hardware, software, and protocols.
- A **cell phone call** is a practical analogy of how data is converted and transmitted across multiple media while preserving its meaning.
- The **Network+ exam objectives** provide a clear framework for learning and tracking progress.

## Using the OSI Model to Describe Network Operations
### Introduction
In this module, Ross Bagurdes introduces the **OSI model**, a fundamental framework used to describe how different components of a network interact in a structured and layered manner.

Goals of the module:
- Introduce the OSI model.
- Revisit the phone call analogy between Leia and Obi.
- Model network operations using the OSI framework.
### What Is the OSI Model?
- **OSI** stands for **Open Systems Interconnect**.
- Developed in the 1970s to **standardize** how data communications are described and categorized.
- Provides a **structured way** to understand how protocols interact in a **specific order of operations**.

Just like a telephone call follows an exact sequence (air vibrations → microphone → electrical → wireless → back to audio), network communication also follows **a strict set of rules and layers**.

### Home Network Example
1. **PC / Workstation (Client)** – End-user device to access the internet.
2. **Wireless Router** – Provides local connectivity via wired or wireless connections.
3. **Modem** – Bridges the local network to the ISP and the wider internet.
4. **Internet Cloud** – Represents the vast number of interconnected devices and protocols.
5. **Server** – Destination of user requests (e.g., Pluralsight).

Example:
A user enters `pluralsight.com` in their browser.
- The workstation sends a request to the server.
- The server responds with the website content.
- Data travels across multiple devices, cables, and protocols in a **layered** manner.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- **Description:** Physical medium of transmission (wired or wireless).
- **Components:**
  - Twisted pair cables (Ethernet)
  - Coaxial cables (ISP connection)
  - Fiber optic cables (internet backbone)
  - Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, point-to-point links)
- **Function:** Defines physical specifications, connectors, and media types.

This layer does **not** process data logically — it only defines **how signals are transmitted**.
### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- **Description:** Defines protocols that **move data across the physical media**.
- **Common Protocols:**
  - **Ethernet** (PC ↔ Router, Router ↔ Modem, Server ↔ Switches)
  - **DOCSIS** (Modem ↔ ISP)
- **Function:**
  - Provides structure to use physical media.
  - Defines how frames are created, transmitted, and processed.
  - Enables communication **within a local segment**.
### Layer 3: Network Layer
- **Description:** Enables communication **between networks**, not just local devices.
- **Key Protocol:** **Internet Protocol (IP)**.
- **Function:**
  - Logical addressing (IP addresses).
  - Routing between devices across different networks.
  - Establishes the path for packets from the source to the destination (e.g., Workstation → Pluralsight server).
### Layer 4: Transport Layer
- **Description:** Manages sessions between two devices for reliable communication.
- **Key Protocol:** **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**.
- **Analogy:**
  - Dialing a number
  - Waiting for the phone to ring
  - Saying hello on both ends
  - Beginning the conversation
- **Function:**
  - Sets up a session using TCP’s **three-way handshake**.
  - Ensures data is delivered in order and without errors.
  - Uses IP to find devices and Data Link + Physical layers to transfer the packets.
### Layer 7: Application Layer
- **Description:** Interfaces directly with the end user or application.
- **Key Protocols:**
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**
  - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**
- **Function:**
  - Web browsers use HTTP/HTTPS to request HTML documents.
  - Servers respond with content (e.g., web pages, files, data).
  - Operates independently from lower-layer transmission mechanisms.

### Layers 5 and 6: Session and Presentation
- **Layer 6 (Presentation):**
  - Historically used for **data format translation** between different encoding standards.
  - **ASCII** vs **EBCDIC** translation (e.g., “Don’t Panic” encoded differently).
  - Rarely used today—most functions are handled by applications.
- **Layer 5 (Session):**
  - Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
  - Some protocols operate here, but **in modern networks**, most session handling is part of the **Application Layer**.

#### Key Takeaways
* The **OSI model** gives a **structured, layer-by-layer** view of network communication.
* Each layer has **specific responsibilities** and protocols.
* Physical and Data Link layers focus on **local delivery**, while Network and Transport extend that communication **across networks**.
* Application layer protocols handle **user-facing functionality**.
* Layers 5 and 6 are mostly historical but help explain how networking evolved.

Understanding the OSI model provides a **strong foundation** for analyzing, troubleshooting, and designing networks in a clear, systematic way.
